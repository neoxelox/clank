      The Customer represents, covenants, and warrants that it will use the Services only in compliance with the
      Company's standard published policies then in effect (the "Policy") and all applicable laws and regulations. The
      Customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any damages, losses, liabilities, settlements,
      and expenses (including without limitation costs and attorneys' fees) in connection with any claim or action that

    <Title id:auto>3. Confidentiality and Proprietary Rights.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      Each party (the "Receiving Party") understands that the other party (the "Disclosing Party") has disclosed or may
      disclose business, technical, or financial information relating to the Disclosing Party's business (hereinafter
      referred to as "Proprietary Information" of the Disclosing Party). The Proprietary Information of the Company
      includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, and performance of the Service. Proprietary
      Information of the Customer includes non-public data provided by the Customer to the Company to enable the
      provision of the Services ("Customer Data"). The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to take reasonable precautions to
      protect such Proprietary Information, and (ii) not to use (except in the performance of the Services or as
      otherwise permitted herein) or divulge to any third party any such Proprietary Information. The Disclosing Party
      agrees that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any information after 5 years following the disclosure
      thereof or any information that the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally available to the
      public, or (b) was in its possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was
      rightfully disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (d) was independently developed without the
      use of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, or (e) is required to be disclosed by law.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The Customer shall own all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Data. The Company shall own and
      retain all right, title, and interest in and to (a) the Services and Software, including all improvements,
      enhancements, or modifications thereto, (b) any software, applications, inventions, or other technology developed
      in connection with support, and (c) all intellectual property rights related to any of the foregoing.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Company shall have the right to collect and analyze data and other
      information relating to the provision, use, and performance of various aspects of the Services and related systems
      and technologies (including, without limitation, information concerning Customer Data and data derived therefrom),
      and the Company will be free (during and after the term hereof) to use such information and data to improve and
      enhance the Services and for other development, diagnostic, and corrective purposes in connection with the
      Services and other Company offerings.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>4. Payment of Fees.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      The Customer will pay the Company the applicable fees described in the Order Form for the Services in accordance
      with the terms therein (the "Fees"). The Company reserves the right to change the Fees or applicable charges and
      to institute new charges and Fees at the end of the Initial Service Term or the then-current renewal term, upon 30
      days prior notice to the Customer (which may be sent by email). If the Customer believes that the Company has
      billed them incorrectly, they must contact the Company no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first
      billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, to receive an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be
      directed to the Company's customer support department at <Link href="mailto:support@clank.so"
        >support@clank.so</Link
      >.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The primary usage metric for billing is "Capacity" (the "Credits"). Credits are consumed by the amount of
      COLLECTED (not processed) feedback by the Service. Fees vary among three plans: "Starter", "Business", and
      "Enterprise"; (the "Plan"). The Plan includes a specified amount of Credits and has a recurring (monthly or
      annually) base fee. The included Credits and base fee for the "Enterprise" plan are custom and vary based on the
      agreement reached with the Customer. In the event that the Customer purchases additional Credits on demand, a new
      invoice shall be issued for the value of the additional Credits. There will be no reimbursements for partial
      periods of service, plan reductions, unused time or unused Credits.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The Company may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued in any given
      month must be received by the Company 30 days after the mailing date of the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to
      a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is
      lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in immediate termination of Service. The Customer will not
      be able to make any payments to the Company for the services with a reduction of the taxes that the rendered
      services levy. If the Company is compelled to collect or pay taxes, these taxes will be invoiced to the Customer,
      unless the Customer provides the Company with a valid tax exemption certificate issued by the competent tax
      authority.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>5. Term and Termination.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      Subject to earlier termination as provided below, this Agreement is for the Initial Service Term as specified in
      the Order Form and shall be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same duration as the Initial
      Service Term (collectively, the "Term"), unless either party requests termination at least 30 days prior to the
      end of the then-current term.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also terminate this Agreement upon 30 days notice
      (or without notice in the case of nonpayment) if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or
      conditions of this Agreement. The Customer will pay in full for the Services up to and including the last day on
      which the Services are provided. Upon any termination, the Company will make all Customer Data available to the
      Customer for electronic retrieval for a period of 30 days. Thereafter, the Company may, but is not obligated to,
      delete stored Customer Data, except when required by applicable law, including but not limited to the General Data
      Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Customer has the right and may request the Company to delete their data in
      accordance with applicable laws. All sections of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination
      will survive termination, including, without limitation, accrued rights to payment, confidentiality obligations,
      warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>6. Warranty and Disclaimer.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      The Company shall use reasonable efforts consistent with prevailing industry standards to maintain the Services in
      a manner that minimizes errors and interruptions in the Services and shall perform the Implementation Services in
      a professional and workmanlike manner. Services may be temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance or for
      unscheduled emergency maintenance, either by the Company or by third-party providers, or because of other causes
      beyond the Company's reasonable control, but the Company shall use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice in
      writing or by email of any scheduled service disruption.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE; NOR DOES IT MAKE ANY
      WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN
      THIS SECTION, THE SERVICES AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL
      WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
      FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>7. Limitation of Liability.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, EXCEPT FOR BODILY INJURY OF A PERSON, THE COMPANY AND ITS SUPPLIERS
      (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIERS), OFFICERS, AFFILIATES, REPRESENTATIVES,
      CONTRACTORS, AND EMPLOYEES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT
      OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER THEORY: (A) FOR
      ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF USE OR FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
      GOODS, SERVICES, OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF BUSINESS; (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (C) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND THE COMPANY'S REASONABLE CONTROL; OR (D) FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT,
      TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COMPANY FOR
      THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY, IN EACH CASE,
      WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>8. Miscellaneous.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or
      eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force and effect
      and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable, or sublicensable by the Customer except with the
      Company's prior written consent. The Company may transfer and assign any of its rights and obligations under this
      Agreement without consent. This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of
      the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications, and other
      understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all waivers and modifications must be in
      writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
      employment is created as a result of this Agreement and the Customer does not have any authority of any kind to
      bind the Company in any respect whatsoever. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement,
      the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees. All notices under this Agreement will
      be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is
      electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day
      delivery by a recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or registered mail,
      return receipt requested.

    <Paragraph>
      This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Spain without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and both

      resolve claims derived from these conditions or from the Company's services.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
