    <Paragraph>
      The EEA/EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), UK GDPR and Switzerland Federal Act on Data Protection

    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Consent.</b> We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal

    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      <b>Legitimate Interests.</b> We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve
      our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms.
      For example, we may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to: (a) Send customers
      information about special offers and discounts on our products and services; (b) Analyze how our Services are used

      consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about withdrawing your consent in the Your Privacy
      Rights section of this policy.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without
      your consent, including, for example: (a) If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent
      cannot be obtained in a timely way; (b) For investigations and fraud detection and prevention; (c) For business
      transactions provided certain conditions are met; (d) If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection
      is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim; (e) For identifying injured, ill, or deceased
      persons and communicating with next of kin; (f) If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been,
      is, or may be victim of financial abuse; (g) If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would
      compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes
      related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province; (h) If
      disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the
      production of records; (i) If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
      profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced; (j) If the
      collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes; (k) If the information is publicly
      available and is specified by the regulations.

      technological development and demonstration. We may disclose your personal information with our service providers
      pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider. This is not considered to be "selling" of
      your personal information. We have not sold or shared any personal information to third parties for a business or

    <Title id:auto>4. Sharing of Information.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who
      perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. We have contracts
      in place with our third parties, which are designed to help safeguard your personal information. This means that
      they cannot do anything with your personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They will also not
      share your personal information with any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the data they
      hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we instruct.

    <Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
      other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will require us keeping your personal information for longer
      than 12 months past the start of the idle period of the customer's account.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>6. Safety of Information.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
      the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
      information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
      be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third
      parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
      Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and
      from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>7. Social Logins.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details
      (like your Google or Apple logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about
      you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
      provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address and profile picture, as well as other
      information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Policy or that are
      otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible
      for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you
      review their privacy policy to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you
      can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>8. Cookies and Tracking Technologies.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you
      interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and
      your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, assist with basic site functions and optimize the
      customers' experience by customizing our web page content based on visitors' browser type and/or other
      information. Learn more about the type of information we collect in the Collection of Information section of this
      policy.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser
      to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect
      certain features or services of our Services.
    </Paragraph>
    <Title id:auto>9. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features.</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature
      or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
      DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
      that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
      Policy.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is
      not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
    </Paragraph>

        >support@clank.so</Link

      information in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
      or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
      maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
      identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      If you are located in the EEA/EU or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you

      service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      At any point in time, a customer can ask for their data to be deleted. According to European law, The General Data

    <Paragraph>
      You have rights under certain US state data protection laws (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)).
      However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases, we may decline your request as permitted by law.
      These rights include: (a) Right to know whether or not we are processing your personal data; (b) Right to access
      your personal data; (c) Right to correct inaccuracies in your personal data; (d) Right to request the deletion of
      your personal data; (e) Right to obtain a copy of the personal data you previously shared with us; (f) Right to
      non-discrimination for exercising your rights; (g) Right to opt out of the processing of your personal data if it
      is used for targeted advertising (or sharing as defined under California's privacy law), the sale of personal
      data, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects ("profiling");
      Depending upon the state where you live, you may also have the following rights: (h) Right to obtain a list of the
      categories of third parties to which we have disclosed personal data (as permitted by applicable law, including
      California's privacy law); (i) Right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal data (as permitted by
      applicable law, including California's privacy law).
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      To exercise these rights, you can contact us at <Link href="mailto:support@clank.so">support@clank.so</Link>. Upon
      receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we
      have the information in our system. We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your
      identity or authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already
      maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your
      identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. Under certain US state data protection laws, you can
      designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent
      that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with
      applicable laws.

      California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our customers who are
      California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories
      of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
      addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar
      year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact us at <Link
