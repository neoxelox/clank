# clank ðŸ¤–

**`Collect and analyze customer feedback, identify issues and suggestions, predict churn and retention, track CX KPIs and synthesize interactive customer personas.`**

# Backstory

Clank is a _failed_, solopreneur attempt, of building a B2B (bootstrapped) startup. I designed and envisioned it as _the_ SaaS tool to help companies build better products, by collecting and analyzing customer feedback at scale with AI.

> **TLDR of why it failed:** I didnâ€™t have enough authority _(and motivation)_ to make companies believe in Clank and its services.

Clank was a B2B targeted to big companies, a great amount of reviews was needed for my tool to make sense. I was an outsider of the customer experience field, a solopreneur without a personal brand, that didn't even have connections in the industry.

As it was a B2B, the selling process was very long and not really automatizable. Everyday, I had to be, all the time, in a lot of meetings, with a lot of different companies, and at the end, I realized that was not what I wanted to do with my life.

> I love creating things, making products, but not selling them.

I'm proud of what I achieved and implemented, and I wanted to save my work for future reference, so I open sourced it.
