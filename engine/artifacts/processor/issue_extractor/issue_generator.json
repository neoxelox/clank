Every day at my job I\u2019m moving around a lot so I keep a backpack on me with things I need. In which my bag can get pretty heavy, so my last backpack, that lasted me years, began tearing apart. It definitely didn\u2019t have as much storage as this one too. This backpack has so many pockets and space and storage areas. Even a car keychain clip inside! I thought that was pretty cool. The padding on the back of it really makes it comfortable to wear, even for extended periods of time. Like I had stated above, I do need to be wearing a backpack for a lot of my day and my old one would make my shoulders and back hurt. But even with many heavy things inside of it, this backpack is still comfortable! All and all, I genuinely love this backpack and I recommend it to anyone who\u2019s is considering buying it!\"}",
