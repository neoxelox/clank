    "review_text": "I\u2019ve earned well over $500,000 USD on my network with the business plan. Not saying this to boast, but to indicate that I\u2019ve got the experience with MN to make some observations. Overall, the platform is very good. I\u2019m not certain that I would have chosen MN if I\u2019d known four years ago what I know now. My #1 complaint is that MN absolutely sucks at informing hosts of networks about things that matter. Case in point: I just found out that there was an update for the app when I opened the App Store. My #2 grumble is that MN constantly has glitches. There\u2019s never not something that\u2019s not working as it should. #3 MN is 100% committed to getting hosts to spend more money. These three are intertwined. When we launched on MN, the staff seemed to be interested in helping hosts build enduring communities. That all changed a couple of years ago when they started to focus on getting hosts to upgrade to increasingly expensive plans, buying \u201cCommunity Building,\u201d courses, and making ridiculous claims about how easy it was to make buckets of money. For example, \u201csix figure summer.\u201d MN feels like a marketing scheme where staff don\u2019t care much about the quality of their product. Reminds me of when my parents got sucked into selling Amway back in the eighties.  But here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s actually a good product.  Like that Amway laundry detergent. If they would do better at communicating with hosts and improve coding to fix the incessant glitches, which would require redirecting their energy away from the MLM vibes, it could be great.",

I had mailed the company to see if the cruise was going ahead, taking into consideration the weather and the predictions (in every bloody web site going!) there would be 0% chance of seeing the lights.\n\nCruise went ahead and the crew/ guides \u2018kept up\u2019 the myth of seeing the lights\u2026 and we basically just sailed around Tromso island! \n\nBecause we didn\u2019t see the lights, at the end we were offered to come back for another cruise\u2026 but we were going home the next day! \n\nI don\u2019t feel the company was very honourable in not offering the chance to cancel the trip.. or at least give the guests the option, as had another tour company we booked an excursion with.\n\n A waste of money.. couldn\u2019t even see any scenery due to the dark & heavy snow!",

We can see the lake from dining area and have an abundance of ducks,pheasants and little birds including a red breasted nuthatch that visit most days. The shower is super hot and supplied with soft white towels.  It is the most tranquil place I have ever stayed. We are surrounded by woodland and life slows down here. The staff are very helpful, friendly and there if you need them.  Of course we could not stay here and not go to the on site restaurant, but do book to avoid disappointment. We shared the baked Camembert as a starter, it was fabulous and then we had pizza with a thin crispy base along with a lovely bottle of wine.  As someone who is always in the kitchen at home I can never resist going into Julia\u2019s shop, I actually didn\u2019t buy for the kitchen but a knitted hat for me but there is always something to tempt you. It\u2019s probably about 30 minutes by car into Stirling and 20 minutes into Callender where there is a wide river with a seated area and a decent car park. A good selection of shops and cafes and a wonderful bakery line the main road.  We stayed for a week and it\u2019s never long  enough so we are returning next year. Thank you for your hospitality.

We were lucky to upgrade to a seaview room, and although it was February, it was well worth it. \nOur room was huge, the beds comfy with starch white linen. We were given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco.  Tea and coffee was in the room. \nWe had a lovely big shower, but no complimentary toiletries, so bring your own. \n The food was ok, I wouldn\u2019t rave about it, except the Sunday roast that was nice and very reasonable. \nThe hotel pool was nice, very quiet during the day. \nA walk into town takes about 20 mins.",

    "review_text": "I rang and booked a table for 3 on Monday evening,  having next to no choice locally on Mondays.   We were sat in the bar right next to the entrance/exit , after a while we asked if another table was available and were seated other side of bar.  The food was poor quality and overpriced for a local pub!   My friend had to ask for a steak knife which should have been supplied with our cutlery!   Scampi was served with cold peas!  My fish was poor quality and tasteless and chips underneath were just bits !  \nWe tried to get the attention of a waiter who was chatting to his friends on another table to rectify our issues and he was very rude and unhelpful! Which was both embarrassing and upsetting as my friends were visiting!  \nWe spoke to the head waiter when asking for the bill and he apologised but the evening was spoiled,  as the bar area had now filled with people on a poker night!! This hadn\u2019t been mentioned when I booked! \nAt my request we were given a 10%discount off the bill!  This was still more expensive than the meal we had the following evening in a lovely restaurant in centre of York. \nA very disappointing experience for visiting friends\u2026. Take note Black Horse!!  You are not a high end restaurant but a local pub with quiz nights/ music etc and you don\u2019t expect overpriced poor service and food!",

    "review_text": "We booked two nights at the Plantation having read such good reviews. However, once we arrived we found the host patronising and unwelcoming. We were not prepared for how many dogs would be on the property (five) and they were aggressive and extremely loud, disturbing the sense of peacefulness amidst nature. \n\nThe pool was lovely, however the cabins were rudimentary at best. Extremely old and uncomfortable bedding with just one pillow, and the whole room looked bleak.  \n\nWhilst it\u2019s not a hotel and we didn\u2019t expect 5* service, we were surprised to see the host watch us drag our bags from the taxi to the cabin without any offer of help. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best, and late served - which was particularly frustrating when they did not have alternative food to order and one-hour meal times were strictly defined in the guest documents. \n\nWe did not appreciate the host trying to hard sell his cashew liquor at every opportunity. He was completely disinterested in his guests, rather spoke at us at length about his business and how tourism is ruining Goa. Ironic,  considering his decision to offer accommodation to tourists. \n\nAlso considering Goa is dark after 6pm, the lighting in our cabins was very poor, which made it very hard to read, and there is absolutely nothing else to do in the evenings (Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t reach the rooms and you are isolated in the forest).\n\nTo top it all off, when we paid for our dinner and drinks, the host failed to return the correct change. If you are looking for an enjoyable stay in Goa, this may not be for you. However, the guide Sam (organised through the host) who took us on a jungle hike to see the waterfall was FANTASTIC and we would highly recommend him. He knew about every single animal, was extremely respectful of nature, and a delight to talk to.",

The food was excellent with plenty of choice fresh meat and Fish each day and excellent service. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a spacious room with large bathroom, balcony overlooking the sea and well kept gardens, also a very comfy bed and good storage. The whole resort was immaculately clean especially the pools and walkways. The entertainment was varied with local music and dancing each night. I would definitely go back and recommend it to family and friends.",

I started with the octupus which was the best I have tasted in the algarve , my wife started with the prawns in a sumptuous sauce which we were advised to add some bread to our order - great idea ! I ended up finishing off my wife\u2019s starter as it was so so good . Mains we both went for the seabass , fish was so white and tender , you could tell it was so fresh . Desert was the homemade apple pie and ice cream , so different to back in England but so tasty . The meal in general I could not fault and the price of the meal very reasonable for the experience we had . We will definitely be back next year .",

    "review_text": "This house a charming old boutique hotel in the centre of Bridport. It has a Tardis-like feel as rooms extend back into a lovely wisteria clad courtyard (which does pizzas in summer). The staff are young and warmly welcoming and it accepts dogs. The bed was a good size, comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed. However\u2026\n\nWe could not turn the central heating off. Even with the window open, and the radiator thermostat turned down, we roasted. Our poor dog ( no water bowl) was especially miserable.\n\nThe food is terrible. Evening meal ( pheasant pie in one case, fish pie the other) was a nasty mush, reheated in a microwave. Not worth \u00a322 each. Breakfast also dire - if you avoided the cooked one, it was a choice of cornflakes or rice Krispies. A scattering of fresh fruit and yoghurt and some small croissants of the supermarket variety not good enough. Coffee barely drinkable.\n\nIt\u2019s a real shame that such a nice place is let down this way. Sort these, and the Bull would be worth a stay.",

There\u2019s a gym and a sauna too.  It\u2019s clean and tidy and the staff are all lovely.  Rooms are bungalows with their own patio, scattered throughout the grounds - very spacious accommodation.  Buffet restaurant. Life here is very relaxing and low key, perfect for chilling out.  \nLooking forward to coming back",

We will be coming back , even though we are quite a distance away from Epping . Well done guys and keep up the good work. \nWishing you all the very best for Christmas and a Happy New Year.\nFrom Danny & Sharon.",

Some common problems I have are:\n\n- refuses to show me my updates/notifications (like it\u2019ll give me the badge that I have 3 new, but when I tap onto the tab it either shows there\u2019s nothing there or just a completely blank page like it hasn\u2019t loaded at all)\n\n- just freezes completely, have to force stop the app to fix it\n\n- when you try to save a pin from the preview, the list of boards gets stuck on the loading screen indefinitely. Have to close and reopen the app and then actually go on to the pin itself or the glitch will just repeat. \n\n- crashing, less common but just as annoying\n\n- when mass moving pins from one board to a different board, it saves them into the general board instead of the section I chose. I then have to go in, reselect them all and move to the section again, which works. \n\nI think there\u2019s more things I\u2019m forgetting about but those are what come to mind. My phone is not outdated or broken and is fully updated and in working order, so it\u2019s not a problem on my end. I don\u2019t have any of these problems with the web version on my PC.",

However, never have I used such an established application in the world of social media have so many bugs. Unfortunately these bugs often make me close the app and not open it again for a few days, these bugs are so frustrating. Besides some obvious UX issues that make ease of use difficult and annoying, deleting a pin from one of your boards is one of the hardest things to do without encountering a bug, almost every time without fail, attempting to delete a pin results in the app seizing to respond and requiring a restart. Another common bug is on the front page, it\u2019s a similar issue to deleting a pin. Scrolling works just fine but interacting with the posts such as clicking on them is undoable. This really is a shame as the concept of Pinterest is great and I really enjoy using it. Hope to see some fixes soon.",

    "review_text": "Pinterest is one of the apps that I\u2019ve had for the longest, it is also an app that will remain on my phone and future for a while. It\u2019s so useful for practically anything. From hairstyles,makeup, diy, fashion, trendy, to videos and pictures of careers, school work etc. For anyone who hasn\u2019t got Pinterest I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend it. \nIt\u2019s a place to go for tips and info that quick and easy and even aesthetic. You can pin your favourites and create a board- and with the new update you can now add notes and separate your boards in sections, for all the kings and queens who love organising. \n\n I especially like how they added a feature for hairstyles where you can search my hair type so all my curly and wavy queens and kings can easily search without having to scroll through pictures of hairstyles that don\u2019t apply to their hair. So amazing!! \n\nOne suggestion I have for Pinterest is for those who have had Pinterest for a while so now have 70+ boards. I would love to be able to pin my board names to the search: So say you found this cute pin of a bedroom inspo idea, but you have boards where ones aesthetic rooms yet your other is rooms that- like a list of things you want to get for your room in pins. When you find that pin and press save, sometimes it doesn\u2019t show up as one of the top 3 boards- so you proceed scrawling through for me 140 boards from A to Z. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change- just to have some boards pinned to the top that I can order to make it easier when I\u2019m pinning a picture! \nThank you so much creators of Pinterest I do enjoy the app is is absolutely miraculous. Have a blessing day.\n\nUpdate: the new update is sooo cool!! Being able to create collages is amazing, normally when making a vision board it\u2019s very time consuming- but now it\u2019s all on the app! And you can download your finished collage and set it as a wallpaper if you like\ud83c\udf80\u2728\ud83e\ude77",

I reported this to Revolut and instead of investigating they asked to see them even though I clearly explained they were unrelated to me and I had no access to them Revolut then blocked my account? Punished for being honest I guess? \n After inquiring about this for several weeks\u2026 I received a termination of account email\u2026 \nWhen I inquired on twitter they refused to tell me why and said that if continued to pester them they block my twitter\u2026 \nSo for being one of revoluts first customer and for being honest.. and being related to the victim of a scam.. for asking questions and wanting to access my legally obtained money after several months of customer service conversations\u2026. I was blocked repeatedly and then terminated\u2026 \n\nThis truly is the worst service I have ever used.. \n\nI\u2019ve been using Monzo since and it\u2019s much better in every way even though it lacks certain features it\u2019s much more honest and reliable.

I\u2019ve stayed at dozens of hostels and was never asked for my card info prior to arrival. It seemed suspicious, so I asked them to have HostelWorld notify me directly if an action is needed. Instead, they canceled my reservation a few days before I arrived and HostelWorld wouldn\u2019t refund my deposit. I had to book another place for 2x the price due to short notice. Second: Myself and two others were robbed within 1 week in the same hostel. I was robbed twice. The reception could have been more helpful by looking at hallway footage but said it would take too long! I left a factual & honest review for the hostel, warning others of the theft in respectful language, and HostelWorld deleted my review.",

I say \u201cdeposit\u201d because it goes directly to them and not to the hostel you\u2019re booking through. HostelWorld doesn\u2019t allow you to change your booking on their website, only cancel which can be inconvenient if you only want to update and not completely delete the reservation. If you want to update your reservation you have to go through the hostel directly. If you update through the hostel, that \u201cdeposit\u201d you paid is not put towards your new balance and it is non-refundable. So basically that money is gone and you don\u2019t get it back. Since the money was never sent to the hostel they have no way of helping you. Most hostels don\u2019t charge a deposit on your booking so I would ALWAYS go through them directly.

Great for backpackers looking to meet up and make friends. However, not every property listed is truly a hostel, and be sure to check that the dorm or price listed available is applicable to you (female only dorms). At the risk of private equity completely commercializing hostel adventures for profit, sometimes you can save a few bucks and book directly with a hostel website and rather than this app taking 10% or so. I hope this app can continue to leverage technology and it\u2019s network size while still creating authentic travel experiences.",

Then when I went to the chat function, it said that I needed to book a hostel to unlock, but I had already booked two hostels. Maybe those hostels don\u2019t have chat functions enabled, but my main issue is the Message button not working. Again, that could just be my phone, but everything else in the app has worked for me.

Hostelworld typically doesn\u2019t seem to include taxes and (usually more importantly) fees. So even though you may think you\u2019ve already fully paid, you\u2019ll often need to pay more once you try to check in. It\u2019s never been more than like 30% extra or so of your initial price, but that\u2019s still significant and I don\u2019t understand why Hostelworld can\u2019t include that in the price you pay through the app, or at least SHOW the full price you\u2019ll actually pay when you\u2019re comparing hostels. (Note that I\u2019m not even talking about those classic scummy spots that charge you extra for sheets once you get there, even though, there too, I feel like Hostelworld should be able to indicate that in the itemized bill, or a notice as you check out that that will be the case).

    "review_text": "Good:  The bed is fine and the water temp and duration of shower is ok (although you have to take a fast 3 minute shower or keeping refreshing).  Cute kitchen and lots of plugs in bed and around hostel. \nNot so good:  needs more hooks in general. There are none in the rooms at all. Ended up hanging towel near window to dry. There are no seats at all in the shower area or bathroom. So, with no hooks or seats, you are holding onto everything to keep from getting wet or putting in floor.  The locker is on the floor under the bed. At first you think, that is smart. No, every time you want something, have to get on the floor, pull it all the way out and then push back. No napkins or things to put over food in microwave to prevent splatters.  Directions for micro are so small, need a magnifying glass to read. I recommend the owner actually checking in and using the hostel like travelers do and most of this can be easily remedied. \nBad:  laundry service. Yes, it is wash and dry. But that is it!  I didn't expect underwear of socks to be folded but pants and shirts?  Instead, they were all thrown into a bag to get super wrinkled. No one told me this. Ever other place includes folding. If not, TELL ME.  I would have gladly been right there to fold or gone elsewhere. When I asked front desk to reset with a damp cloth to steam out clothes, I was told to come back in 2 hours. I go back in an hour just to check and then I'm told that they were not going to do it without another charge.  Well, you know what room I am in, why not come tell me?  You have my phone number and email to tell me.  None of that happened.  I know this is minor, but lack of communication is everything. \nReally bad:  letting clearly ill people stay in a room with other people. My room has a woman who is very sick, coughing, and cannot get out of bed. Yet, she is with 9 others, and not even keeping her curtain closed.",

The \u2018my trips\u2019 section only shows a handful of trips that were completed months and not any of my current bookings. Even the website is full of error messages and most of the time won\u2019t let you modify or cancel bookings. Generally I have to contact the hostel directly through social media and then they have to contact HostelWorld because they can\u2019t even fix things directly on their end. Unbelievable that one of the world\u2019s biggest hostel booking sites continues to be plagued with so many bugs. Fire your developers and start from scratch..",

On Friday 8th March I made a Reservation for two nights with Franz Josef Montrose through Hostelworld, with the Flexible Deposit Protection option. I arrived after the checkin time of 8pm, so I cancelled my booking for both nights. I was charged by FranzJosef Montrose for both nights, despite their cancellation policy stating that the cost of only one night is to be paid upon cancellation. They have sent me an email stating that they have refunded me the cost of one night, however this transaction has not yet taken place according to my account balance via my internet banking. Also I have not received back my deposit of US$20.87, on which I chose the \u201cFlexible Deposit Protection\u201d option. It seems that making bookings  through Hostelworld is not free of errors and potentially exploitive if the errors escape the customers attention. I am unhappy with both Franz Josef Montrose and Hostelworld. \nAnd another difficulty I experienced  was when I attempted phoning the number listed on your website. It is not compatible with Telstra Australia, the biggest service provider in Australia. \nThe Hostelworld/ Franz Josef Montrose experience has been anything but easy and trouble free.",

I know they raised these access concerns with you some time ago, but there\u2019s been no improvement in the app\u2019s accessibility. \nThe text is tiny and the colour contrast between text and background is poor. There are no accessibility options within the app to change font size and, although I have Large Text enabled on my iPhone, this app does t have dynamic text, so the font remains stubbornly small. \nIt is so important that app and website designers learn about how they can make their work accessible to everyone and embed accessibility in at the design stage. Nearly 1 in 4 people in the UK are disabled, so that\u2019s a lot of people to ignore!",

The edit menu to highlight, change colour, sometimes comes under the normal copy paste menu so you can\u2019t use it. Basically very bad text editor designed very badly. Images added also have a mind of their own and the options for images sometimes don\u2019t work. You type something and go get a cup of tea, the app restarts on its own and you loose what you typed. Takes a long time to colour text etc and you justify something to the centre and the top paragraph also does so. Sometimes the articles do not come according latest first and finally had to just give up. Wasted the 1200 I have paid over two years",

Also the iPad app will not orient upside down, with power button at bottom. Sometimes I hold it this way in my lap if I have a power cable attached. Most apps orient ok, but not this one.

Now anytime I search for anything related to my interests or work, it just comes up with an endless stream of 10 second videos and not a single photo in sight. Even disabling autoplay does nothing to help this and there isn\u2019t a \u201cpictures only\u201d filter option. I am honestly so sad about this because I have used this platform basically since its inception many many years ago and has sadly opted for the same crappy approach to all platforms nowadays, all because of TikTok making video shorts the new default mechanic across all apps including this one. I was wrong to think Pinterest was better than the rest but I guess corporate greed and the brain rot of its users to increase engagement will always come first.",

I was banned last month because the pins i saved were against community guidelines. First of all, I didn\u2019t MAKE the pins so why should i get banned because of someone else\u2019s mistake? That\u2019s unfair. And second, I\u2019d never been banned before on that account, you guys just took my account away from me without a warning.. also unfair. I want to be given a chance to fix my mistake and if i get my account back i promise ill go through every single board and delete the pins that i think go against community guidelines. Pinterest played a massive role in my everyday life, id go on it every single day and look and save pins. I had so many pins on there and now its all just gone. I\u2019m so upset because of this. I don\u2019t even want to go onto the app because every pin i saved is gone and i have to start from scratch. Respond to my emails please because i really want to be given the chance to fix this mistake.",

    "review_text": "Pinterest was wonderful and I\u2019ve used it religiously for the past 10 years and probably have millions of pins saved. Now three things have become recently bad enough for me to come to the review section and write one but only for the phone app. The Pinterest website at least on a laptop is still as wonderful as it always was.\n1) Ads\n2) Crashing the app\n3) Constant changes to how to work with the pins\n\n1. I\u2019d attach a screenshot if I could, but sometimes, there\u2019s more ads on the screen then there are pins. If you fit 6 pins on the screen, 3 of them are often ads. There\u2019s always a minimum of one no matter where you are and if you accidentally press one it straight away opens a new link.\n2. If you scrolling through saved pins, and you\u2019re going through each one individually, there\u2019s the little icon on the bottom right corner that sometimes blocks the words written on the pin. So if you touch the pin and move it down a little you can read the entire text. Now the problem is if you do that, sometimes it crashes the app so bad it exits you out, or it blanks the screen so you have to go back to the homepage and then back to your saved pins and it starts you back at the top of the board. It\u2019s been a problem when I had the iPhone 11 pro but now I have a 15 and exact same problem. \n3. The way that Pinterest work changes once every couple months for about a week to a month, then they revert back to how it was. About two weeks ago, they did it so you had to swipe right out of a pin instead of swiping down, but now they\u2019ve changed it back. That\u2019s just the most recent, but stuff like this happens all the time and you always have to change how you\u2019re doing it and relearn something that\u2019s been the same for years and worked perfectly well.\n\nOther than that Pinterest is amazing it\u2019s just their mobile app mess ups that make it less enjoyable to use.",

Users of Pinterest under 16 are unable to configure their privacy settings, which makes it difficult to view friends boards who happen to be under 16.\nIn conclusion, Pinterest is an awesome app which I would highly recommend, but I would advise Pinterest to remove the 16 or under rule.\nThis took three attempts to complete so thank you for reading :D",

Have to close and reopen the app and then actually go on to the pin itself or the glitch will just repeat. \n\n- crashing, less common but just as annoying\n\n- when mass moving pins from one board to a different board, it saves them into the general board instead of the section I chose. I then have to go in, reselect them all and move to the section again, which works. \n\nI think there\u2019s more things I\u2019m forgetting about but those are what come to mind. My phone is not outdated or broken and is fully updated and in working order, so it\u2019s not a problem on my end. I don\u2019t have any of these problems with the web version on my PC.",

However, never have I used such an established application in the world of social media have so many bugs. Unfortunately these bugs often make me close the app and not open it again for a few days, these bugs are so frustrating. Besides some obvious UX issues that make ease of use difficult and annoying, deleting a pin from one of your boards is one of the hardest things to do without encountering a bug, almost every time without fail, attempting to delete a pin results in the app seizing to respond and requiring a restart. Another common bug is on the front page, it\u2019s a similar issue to deleting a pin. Scrolling works just fine but interacting with the posts such as clicking on them is undoable. This really is a shame as the concept of Pinterest is great and I really enjoy using it. Hope to see some fixes soon.",

    "review_text": "Pinterest is one of the apps that I\u2019ve had for the longest, it is also an app that will remain on my phone and future for a while. It\u2019s so useful for practically anything. From hairstyles,makeup, diy, fashion, trendy, to videos and pictures of careers, school work etc. For anyone who hasn\u2019t got Pinterest I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend it. \nIt\u2019s a place to go for tips and info that quick and easy and even aesthetic. You can pin your favourites and create a board- and with the new update you can now add notes and separate your boards in sections, for all the kings and queens who love organising. \n\n I especially like how they added a feature for hairstyles where you can search my hair type so all my curly and wavy queens and kings can easily search without having to scroll through pictures of hairstyles that don\u2019t apply to their hair. So amazing!! \n\nOne suggestion I have for Pinterest is for those who have had Pinterest for a while so now have 70+ boards. I would love to be able to pin my board names to the search: So say you found this cute pin of a bedroom inspo idea, but you have boards where ones aesthetic rooms yet your other is rooms that- like a list of things you want to get for your room in pins. When you find that pin and press save, sometimes it doesn\u2019t show up as one of the top 3 boards- so you proceed scrawling through for me 140 boards from A to Z. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change- just to have some boards pinned to the top that I can order to make it easier when I\u2019m pinning a picture! \nThank you so much creators of Pinterest I do enjoy the app is is absolutely miraculous. Have a blessing day.\n\nUpdate: the new update is sooo cool!! Being able to create collages is amazing, normally when making a vision board it\u2019s very time consuming- but now it\u2019s all on the app! And you can download your finished collage and set it as a wallpaper if you like\ud83c\udf80\u2728\ud83e\ude77",

On Friday 8th March I made a Reservation for two nights with Franz Josef Montrose through Hostelworld, with the Flexible Deposit Protection option. I arrived after the checkin time of 8pm, so I cancelled my booking for both nights. I was charged by FranzJosef Montrose for both nights, despite their cancellation policy stating that the cost of only one night is to be paid upon cancellation. They have sent me an email stating that they have refunded me the cost of one night, however this transaction has not yet taken place according to my account balance via my internet banking. Also I have not received back my deposit of US$20.87, on which I chose the \u201cFlexible Deposit Protection\u201d option. It seems that making bookings  through Hostelworld is not free of errors and potentially exploitive if the errors escape the customers attention. I am unhappy with both Franz Josef Montrose and Hostelworld. \nAnd another difficulty I experienced  was when I attempted phoning the number listed on your website. It is not compatible with Telstra Australia, the biggest service provider in Australia. \nThe Hostelworld/ Franz Josef Montrose experience has been anything but easy and trouble free.",

Also you should add a camera simble next to all the chats so you can just click on that and send a specific photo to each chat, instead of changing it in settings every time\ud83d\ude2b another good reason is because Snapchat is 17+ or something so basically no one is allowed it, if you include these simple things then it might just be the next big app, isn\u2019t that what you want??? I know exactly what your thinking why would any idiot like me waste all of this time just for a comment? Well because it\u2019s not just me talking about this, it\u2019s the whole freakin school!! Even the teachers, I am only 16, I don\u2019t expect you to just go and change it but at least try!! Why save the best till last, it\u2019s worth a crack isn\u2019t it?? And if it doesn\u2019t work, just change it back no biggy, and I know I have no idea what I am taking about it\u2019s probably a lot harder than I think it is but just have a go!! You only have one life so why not try and live it instead of trying to survive it???\nYours Sincerely,\nThe great idea!!",

Link it with a phone and you have all of your convosations there that will load quickly. Updates weren't a problem for me and I found it easy and simple to use. You have more features then you have in other standerd apps plus if you like you can slightly customize you backgrounds and sounds for notifications. Overall a great app that you should try out.",

Previously, while exploring the map, stumbling upon towns, islands, or areas with undiscovered hostels led to exciting new opportunities for me. The current search area functionality feels limiting, causing me to overlook potential places to explore and stay. Restoring the ability to roam and search specific locations would enhance my travel experience and increase bookings for hostel owners. Considering this, I now prefer using Booking.com for its more flexible search options. Reintroducing this user-friendly feature would not only benefit my travel experiences but also contribute to the growth and revenue of Hostelworld.",

They have focused far too much on social \u2018chat\u2019 features which were already present in the old app. Why they have removed the wish list is beyond me. It is not even possible to save, star or favourite an accommodation any more, you have to search it again every time to find it. An appalling update and an appalling decision from Hostelworld developers. A favourite feature is the most basic and crucial part of an app, and it is gone? I hope this finds the developers as soon as possible, it needs to be changed and updated right now.",

There are no accessibility options within the app to change font size and, although I have Large Text enabled on my iPhone, this app does t have dynamic text, so the font remains stubbornly small. \nIt is so important that app and website designers learn about how they can make their work accessible to everyone and embed accessibility in at the design stage.

Images added also have a mind of their own and the options for images sometimes don\u2019t work. You type something and go get a cup of tea, the app restarts on its own and you loose what you typed. Takes a long time to colour text etc and you justify something to the centre and the top paragraph also does so.

If I've been watching an hour long class, and wasn't able to view it in one sitting it just resets the video back to the beginning again and I have to figure out for myself how far I got.\n\nSo the navigation is really confusing and hierarchical, personal content like classes feel really buried and it doesn't do a good job of remembering my progress.",

Also the iPad app will not orient upside down, with power button at bottom. Sometimes I hold it this way in my lap if I have a power cable attached. Most apps orient ok, but not this one.

I discovered how to be my own person because I learned how to best live and find my path through so many ways, new and exciting. I studied many wonderful subjects about history, living with pure honesty, kindness, thoughtfulness, peace, and success in finding total happiness.  Exhilaration in my happiness.  \nAt the same time and in th he same book, I found Miss Annabelle, who became my best friend as she taught 12 students, not only what third graders should learn but a new way to think for themselves,build the life they wanted and how to  create success and share it with our world.  \nI love my life, the people I\u2019ve grown to love and appreciate while we all stand together to build our place in the Civilization of the Universe and find peace with the Prime  Law.

They target children under 18 to save their money while taking a cut. This app is a breeding group for scammers and an easy way for Revolt to have zero liability if something does go wrong. Any amount of research online will find a litany of anecdotal cases of poor Aussies being scammed out of thousands of dollars with no compensation. Honestly open up a bank account with an of the big four and they offer excatly the same seevice. CMC markets even. What does Revolut do that is different? Is your money safe with this company?

In some respects it is, it allows you to change currencies and withdraw from atms in foreign countries. Not bad if you plan to use it for a couple of holidays a year.\n\nUnfortunately, if you plan to travel long term, a lot of the advertised perks are completely pointless. Such as the cash back rewards. These are only eligible in the country where you first set up the card, and cannot be changed without cancelling the card and selling your portfolio of stocks/crypto/ commodities. \n\nAs for the travel insurance! This is a complete joke and I urge people not to rely on this as medical cover. It would be a great perk to have from Revolut, but the insurance is provided through a 3rd party - \u2018Allianz\u2019, who have so many clauses and loopholes written in to the cover, it is almost guaranteed you will not be able to make a claim when you need to!\n\nIf Revolut can improve this app so it is more applicable for the long term traveller it would be great. Likewise, they really need to be honest with their customers about what a joke the medical cover is. Fortunately I only missed out on a few hundred dollars, but it is not uncommon for medical expenses to really rack up and it is unlikely you would ever see a penny from this Allianz/ Revolut cover.",

But they said they can not cancel it and \u00a32200 was sent at the end. And there is no way I can get it back.

I reported this to Revolut and instead of investigating they asked to see them even though I clearly explained they were unrelated to me and I had no access to them Revolut then blocked my account? Punished for being honest I guess? \n After inquiring about this for several weeks\u2026 I received a termination of account email\u2026 \nWhen I inquired on twitter they refused to tell me why and said that if continued to pester them they block my twitter\u2026 \nSo for being one of revoluts first customer and for being honest.. and being related to the victim of a scam.. for asking questions and wanting to access my legally obtained money after several months of customer service conversations\u2026. I was blocked repeatedly and then terminated\u2026 \n\nThis truly is the worst service I have ever used.. \n\nI\u2019ve been using Monzo since and it\u2019s much better in every way even though it lacks certain features it\u2019s much more honest and reliable. Monzo is a proper banking system",

I cannot say enough about her level of professionalism and thoroughness.  \n\nCompletely outstanding. \n\nOur guide for the 9 days was Dixon.  He was so knowledgeable about the animals birds floral etc. we learned so much from him.  He was so skilled in finding the animals for us and did everything he could to ensure all our dreams and expectations of a safari were met.  He consistently checked in with us to ensure our needs were met.  One of the most endearing qualities  was his obvious respect and love for the animals.  We were a group of 5 women who love animals so much and Dixon totally met our needs here. He was so patient when we wanted to watch the simplist of animals and was open to all our crazy questions. He ensured we got as much fame driving as we wanted.   He met our needs in terms of tenderness and live of the animals and one could tell this wasn\u2019t just a job for him. He was passionate about what he was seeing out in the game reserves.  We always felt completely safe with him and trusted him with our lives. He never once let us down.  Our experience was beyond what we were expecting.

The captain had wonderful black and white pictures of the stars in the movie. The tour was fun and since the passengers are limited to between 4 to 6, you got to know and have conversations with each other.

    "review_text": "We tried Ixtapa Club Med because we love the Club Med experience and usual first and best properties in the region.  We moved to the West Coast ofCanada and the Caribbean is now a duo of 5 hour flights and 3 hour time zone change.   Friends raved about Ixtapa at Christmas so we have it a try first week of April 2023\n\nFamily resort.  But lots of fun and R&R for adults (us).   Sunny every day.   10 daytime rainfalls a year in the summer    Air temp 35C (95F) and water temp 30C (89F).   Warmest water we have ever experienced in the ocean in the world including Bora Bora and Australia.   Calm weather \n\nClean beach.  Long. No Sargassum weed.   At all.  Soft sand.   Can\u2019t  say enough about the beach.  \n\nFood always fresh.  Many Mexican choices and adults and kids can find water they need including Lamb and Beef Wellington on occasion.    \n\nStaff excellent.  Many mMexican nationals who work hard, interact well and always smile when serving.  Call outs to RUIZ AND ARMUNDO of the service staff\n\nWe stayed in the SOL Suites and had our own Concierge.   Kudos to exceptional service of ANNA.  She took great care of us, our dumb and good questions and June\u2019s is for a meal or two.   Terrific.  \n\nWill go back twice per year.   No complaints",

The hotel exceeded my expectations in every way possible, from the exceptional service to the beautiful rooms.\nUpon arrival, I was welcomed by the friendly staff who made me feel right at home. The check-in process was quick and easy, and the room was spacious, clean, and well-decorated. I couldn't believe how comfortable and luxurious the room was.\n\nThe hotel has a beautiful garden and outdoor seating area which made it an excellent place to relax and unwind. Additionally, the hotel\u2019s restaurant served delicious meals with a great selection of local dishes.\n\nWhat impressed me the most about the Garden Square Hotel was the level of service provided by the staff. They were incredibly attentive and always went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nThe location of the hotel is also very convenient, with easy access to the old town and other major tourist attractions. The hotel\u2019s proximity to the airport also made it a great choice for travelers.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Garden Square Hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay in Krakow. The hotel\u2019s exceptional service, luxurious amenities, and convenient location make it the perfect choice for anyone visiting the city.",

    "review_text": "Advice, tips and pointers\nIf you plan on hitting any of the parks like the ziplines or the ATV rides take the 8:30AM bus to them from Arte. You will be close to the front of the line, you\u2019ll see that because by the time you get to the end of each of those rides some will already be closed because the lines are full. \nIf you\u2019re planning on going to the Xcaret park go Mon - Fri if you can - Sat and Sun are a zoo. If you like birds then you must go to the bird sanctuary - it\u2019s hard to describe but you are following a path from top to bottom in a circular fashion bit doesn\u2019t feel like it. There are nets over the top of the exhibit but you don\u2019t notice them and all of the birds are flying free - except the bald eagle and the condor. At each level on the path there are boulders that tell you what birds you can expect to see. And then it just goes on - there are maps there that you can look at to see what you would like to see most. This park can\u2019t be done in one day!! Come here at night and watch the Mexican Show - the first half explains the culture of Mexico and the second half celebrates the different states/provinces of Mexico.\nIf you only have one week look at what you\u2019d enjoy the most and plan your time. You don\u2019t want to miss the best of what you want to see.",

    "review_text": "We had a wonderful five days here at the resort. Staff are incredibly friendly and more than helpful. We chose to stay in a canopy villa, essentially a treehouse accessible by either a ramp, or a tall staircase. The rooms are luxurious and incredibly comfortable. The beach is beautiful a little rocky, and it was pretty windy when we were her.  the pool is not heated but very refreshing and a beautiful place to watch the sunset. We did their sunset hike to get a 360 of all the islands around and that really was beautiful. The hike is not for those out of shape. we met some amazing people, and saw lots of families enjoying their time. \n\nAre only criticism would be the food. When we first arrived, it was \u00e0 la cart, which was unbelievable the best ceviche I\u2019ve ever had. However, when it got busy, they switched to only buffet at lunch and dinner which became pretty boring by night 4. in addition, nothing on the buffet was ever hot. Furthermore, a great choice for  Eggs in the morning -made  fresh for you, but again, but often arrived to the table, lukewarm and sometimes cool. \n\nOne tip we only learned about the last day was if you don\u2019t want buffet at lunch you can always order \u00e0 la cart from the pool bar!",

    "review_text": "Nous sommes all\u00e9s au Iberostar de cayo cruz du 2-9 f\u00e9vrier 2023. Je vais commencer par les points positifs, le personnel est tr\u00e8s gentil et souriant, l h\u00f4tel ou nous \u00e9tions c\u00f4t\u00e9 famille esmeralda est vraiment tr\u00e8s belle, le hall est a aire ouverte tr\u00e8s moderne et d\u00e9cor\u00e9e avec go\u00fbt!  Les drinks au bar du lobby sont parfaits et tres bons , Les chambres modernes ont une bonne grandeur avec grand balcon. Il y a 3 piscines, une grande centrale tr\u00e8s bruyante, une petite piscine c\u00f4t\u00e9 enfant et une autre un peu plus tranquille, mais quand il y a de l animation tu l entends assez fort partout sur le site de l h\u00f4tel, difficile pour ceux qui veulent se reposer et essayer de dormir . La plage sur une semaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 belle 3 fois, c est a dire sans gros vents ni vagues et presque pas d algues, par contre les 4 autres journ\u00e9es c \u00e9tait vraiment tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s venteux et des tr\u00e8s grosses vagues , drapeau rouge et noir , beaucoup d algues.   Pour le  C\u00f4t\u00e9 n\u00e9gatif , la bouffe \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s ordinaire, on a beau dire que c est Cuba mais ici on ne parle pas d un 2-3 \u00e9toiles quand m\u00eame. Le buffet est tr\u00e8s petit et r\u00e9p\u00e9titif , toute la semaine exactement la m\u00eame bouffe assez basique. Pendant 4 jours il n y a pas eu de lait, oeufs,vin rouge et blanc, beurre, aucune p\u00e2te de toute la semaine, une seule journ\u00e9e ou nous avons eu des frites, aucune vinaigrette pour la salade sauf de l huile assez \u00e9paisse, les seuls fruits \u00e9taient des ananas, papayes et de temps en temps des fruits en cannes, apr\u00e8s 4 jours de ces aliments de bases manquants c a devient un peu irritant de prendre son caf\u00e9 noir et c\u00e9r\u00e9ales sans lait lolll , nourriture pas vraiment go\u00fbteuse, mettons que tu manges pour manger mais vraiment pas pour d\u00e9guster car tout est assez fade . Le service edt tr\u00e8s lent, tu attends toujours longtemps pour avoir une cuill\u00e8re, de l eau, du caf\u00e9 etc... Autre point tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatif est qu il y a beaucoup de russes qui sont vraiment d\u00e9rangeant, coupe la file et passe devant tout le monde, un groupe de 5 personnes ont vid\u00e9 les humbergers qui \u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux personnes du resto assis a la table et qui attendaient leurs assiettes, apres 30 minutes d attentes nous nous sommes fait dire qu il n y en avait plus pour nous, pourtant nous avions command\u00e9 bien avant eux, idem quand tu vas au buffet ou au bar, ce sont les Roi et Ma\u00eetres et les serveurs ne disent rien, vraiment vraiment d\u00e9solant \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f donc pour tout ces inconv\u00e9nients assez d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables , je ne retournerai plus a cette h\u00f4tel .",

I dedicated substantial time and effort to photograph each item personally, meticulously ensuring that the photos were clear and professional by using a white background and even going the extra mile to watermark my images to prevent them from being copied.\n\nHowever, my enthusiasm quickly dwindled when, shockingly, Vinted deleted all my listings, unjustly claiming the photos weren't mine. This accusation couldn't be farther from the truth, as I personally took each photo. \n\nWhat makes this situation even more frustrating is the apparent lack of a reliable mechanism to verify the originality of images, leading to unjustified deletions of authentic listings. Such experiences not only waste the seller's time and effort but also significantly undermine trust in Vintive's systems and policies.\n\nAfter this ordeal, I made the decision to delete my account, concluding that Vinted is not the supportive and reliable platform I initially believed it to be. This incident has been incredibly disheartening, and I feel compelled to advise others to reconsider using  their services.\n\nPotential users, please proceed with caution.",

    "review_text": "The lack of user support is horrible. All you get is automated messages and then you are ignored. Their artificial intelligence mistakes items for something they are not, such as a candle holder. You get a message in regards to your listening being deleted and prohibited, they send u a list of items that are ok to sell and it will list candle holder as an ok item. You appeal the decision and get yet another automatic response with a persons name on the bottom stating it\u2019s a prohibited item. Totally disregarding the fact it\u2019s a picture of candle holders, u state it\u2019s a candle holder and then they call u a liar and delete it. The id verification is a scam. They ask you to up load your drivers license, they verify it with a confirmation message stating it\u2019s successful . Then two weeks later they send you a message banding your ability to withdraw your money from your wallet due to not verifying your identity. You message them and they send you automatic reply stating you didn\u2019t verify your identity correctly. If that\u2019s the case then why send a confirmation message saying it\u2019s successful. To me it seems like they are scamming people and selling the personal information on the black market if they are continuing to ask for your id and social security number. I used to love this app. Now I\u2019m going to contact lifelock and make sure they aren\u2019t stealing my identity. I suggest anyone else being told to constantly re-verify their identity do the same.",

And that\u2019s great however, the information that they want are things like what\u2019s the date that you set up this account? WTH?. \nI have sent the approximate date I think is the account was set up \nmy user ID \nmy email address \nmy date of birth \nA picture of my two credit cards with my name, the full account number and expiration dates,\n I have even given them the full old telephone number, which their site does not provide.  \nIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to me that I can login and yet not be allowed in to change the phone number so I guess like everybody else on here, vented gets to keep all the money from the items that I sold because I never transferred any of it over to my bank account.

They throw a piece of clothing on their bed or floor, snap one photo of it and write no info about it. Obvious they're more interested in money than a satisfied happy customer. The most recent problem I've run into is after I purchase something, they never send it and Vinted has to cancel the order. Too lazy to even put their accounts on vacation mode. I'm over it.",

Like getting your hopes up because they don\u2019t often buy them after offering so why offer on the first place. The only thing I like is that the price that you sell it for is what you will make so it\u2019s easy to see. But right now I finally had a $2.50 sale last night but the label is no where! I\u2019ve emailed support for help this morning, it\u2019s been 10 hours already and they haven\u2019t gotten back. It\u2019s ridiculous.

I never would have booked these accommodations If I had read the Google reviews before hand. My experiences perfectly align with the negative comments on Google. Now, I check the availability of each accommodation on this app and then read the Google reviews before booking. It is annoying having to go back and forth between the two sites,  so this app would be improved by including (or linking to) to Google profile of each accommodation.",

I cancelled all of my bookings on hostelworld, but somehow one of them did not go through. Funnily enough, the cancellation that did not go through was also the most expensive booking out of all of them. Well, because there is no record of me cancelling it, even though I\u2019m 100% sure I did, I will be charged the full amount of my stay which is over 300 dollars. This seems to be some technical issue with this company and now I\u2019m being punished for it. I paid for free cancellation as well, but don\u2019t trust that because if you don\u2019t cancel before 24hrs then they will charge you the entire booking. I will be filing a chargeback with my credit card because no other company or any other booking does this",

    "review_text": "I\u2019ve been a long-time user of WhatsApp and have generally been pleased with its performance and features. However, I would like to bring to your attention a recent change that has notably impacted my user experience.\n\nPreviously, I was able to view WhatsApp statuses with audio, even when my phone was set to silent or vibrate mode. This feature was particularly convenient, as it allowed me to enjoy multimedia content without altering my phone\u2019s general settings. However, following recent updates, I\u2019ve noticed that this is no longer possible. Now, to hear audio in statuses, I have to take my phone off silent mode. This is quite inconvenient, as I prefer to keep my phone on silent most of the time.\n\nI am wondering why this change was implemented, as it seems to be a step back in terms of user convenience and functionality. Being able to consume media content with audio, while the phone is in silent mode, was a valued feature for me and likely for many other users who keep their phones muted as a standard practice.\n\nI hope this feedback is helpful and that consideration is given to reinstating the previous functionality. It would enhance the overall user experience and align with the seamless and user-friendly nature that WhatsApp is known for.",

Now anytime I search for anything related to my interests or work, it just comes up with an endless stream of 10 second videos and not a single photo in sight. Even disabling autoplay does nothing to help this and there isn\u2019t a \u201cpictures only\u201d filter option. I am honestly so sad about this because I have used this platform basically since its inception many many years ago and has sadly opted for the same crappy approach to all platforms nowadays, all because of TikTok making video shorts the new default mechanic across all apps including this one. I was wrong to think Pinterest was better than the rest but I guess corporate greed and the brain rot of its users to increase engagement will always come first.",

I was banned last month because the pins i saved were against community guidelines. First of all, I didn\u2019t MAKE the pins so why should i get banned because of someone else\u2019s mistake? That\u2019s unfair. And second, I\u2019d never been banned before on that account, you guys just took my account away from me without a warning.. also unfair. I want to be given a chance to fix my mistake and if i get my account back i promise ill go through every single board and delete the pins that i think go against community guidelines. Pinterest played a massive role in my everyday life, id go on it every single day and look and save pins. I had so many pins on there and now its all just gone. I\u2019m so upset because of this. I don\u2019t even want to go onto the app because every pin i saved is gone and i have to start from scratch. Respond to my emails please because i really want to be given the chance to fix this mistake.",

I have to go through the website, find a pin and open it in the app to be able to use the app. A bit funky and I've tried everything to fix it. Otherwise though, its user interface is super easy to use",

    "review_text": "Pinterest was wonderful and I\u2019ve used it religiously for the past 10 years and probably have millions of pins saved. Now three things have become recently bad enough for me to come to the review section and write one but only for the phone app. The Pinterest website at least on a laptop is still as wonderful as it always was.\n1) Ads\n2) Crashing the app\n3) Constant changes to how to work with the pins\n\n1. I\u2019d attach a screenshot if I could, but sometimes, there\u2019s more ads on the screen then there are pins. If you fit 6 pins on the screen, 3 of them are often ads. There\u2019s always a minimum of one no matter where you are and if you accidentally press one it straight away opens a new link.\n2. If you scrolling through saved pins, and you\u2019re going through each one individually, there\u2019s the little icon on the bottom right corner that sometimes blocks the words written on the pin. So if you touch the pin and move it down a little you can read the entire text. Now the problem is if you do that, sometimes it crashes the app so bad it exits you out, or it blanks the screen so you have to go back to the homepage and then back to your saved pins and it starts you back at the top of the board. It\u2019s been a problem when I had the iPhone 11 pro but now I have a 15 and exact same problem. \n3. The way that Pinterest work changes once every couple months for about a week to a month, then they revert back to how it was. About two weeks ago, they did it so you had to swipe right out of a pin instead of swiping down, but now they\u2019ve changed it back. That\u2019s just the most recent, but stuff like this happens all the time and you always have to change how you\u2019re doing it and relearn something that\u2019s been the same for years and worked perfectly well.\n\nOther than that Pinterest is amazing it\u2019s just their mobile app mess ups that make it less enjoyable to use.",

Our flight leaves so early she\u2019s not open so you just take to reception with your receipt and they can do the reversal there as well. It is a nice extra benefit of staying here.

Even the Vietnam Tourism Minister chose to stay at this hotel while we were there, which highlights the hotel's exclusivity at a very reasonable price, perhaps half the cost of an average hotel in Hanoi.\nRegarding my personal experience, I had to stay at this hotel due to my individual circumstances. However, the understanding and care shown by the hotel manager and the assistant manager made me feel like a family member, and I will always be grateful to them. \nI am confident that you will enjoy your stay in this hotel and have a wonderful time in Mai Chau.",

    "review_text": "Having seen the Acropolis and Parthenon in pictures since childhood the fascination of the reality of being there could not be dimmed by the hoards of tourists and unrelenting heat in late September. The site and the structures are simply amongst the most magnificent on earth. The pictures in books cannot replace the views from the heights of Athens ( no buildings are allowed anywhere near the height of the Acropolis) and cannot reveal the timelessness and sense of history thick in the air. The constant repair of damage done by the Persians and many others, including failed restoration projects by the Greeks since the 1800s, cannot remove the extraordinary vibe of this ancient seat of great glory and mysterious Gods and great leaders and rulers. The seamless tourist process was very good although we were not offered headphones and an auditory guide which would have been appreciated. The signposting leaves a little to be desired in terms of available options and must have been obstructed by the large crowds.",

Lunch was served, a selection of 5 delicious Thai dishes plus all the fruit you could eat. We stopped to snorkel at Koh Ma , a beautiful cove framed by golden sands. My husband said the fish and coral were beautiful. We set sail again heading to Koh Phangan where we had a choice of massages, walks along the beach or drinks at the bar. All tips at the bar go towards the street dogs. We set sail for  home, enjoying g a spectacular sunset as we returned. Our entry to port was celebrated with fireworks from the onboard cannon.",

Also you should add a camera simble next to all the chats so you can just click on that and send a specific photo to each chat, instead of changing it in settings every time\ud83d\ude2b another good reason is because Snapchat is 17+ or something so basically no one is allowed it, if you include these simple things then it might just be the next big app, isn\u2019t that what you want??? I know exactly what your thinking why would any idiot like me waste all of this time just for a comment? Well because it\u2019s not just me talking about this, it\u2019s the whole freakin school!! Even the teachers, I am only 16, I don\u2019t expect you to just go and change it but at least try!! Why save the best till last, it\u2019s worth a crack isn\u2019t it?? And if it doesn\u2019t work, just change it back no biggy, and I know I have no idea what I am taking about it\u2019s probably a lot harder than I think it is but just have a go!!

Link it with a phone and you have all of your convosations there that will load quickly. Updates weren't a problem for me and I found it easy and simple to use. You have more features then you have in other standerd apps plus if you like you can slightly customize you backgrounds and sounds for notifications. Overall a great app that you should try out.",

I think that they are misusing the word white supremacy for racism. Not only are SOME white people racist but African American people are racist, Asian people are racist, indigenous people are racist. Overall this is discrimination towards one certain group even though \u201cprotected\u201d groups don\u2019t want discrimination they don\u2019t want it from others and then doing it back just add on to all the hate and discrimination in the world. \u201cProtected\u201d groups are basically the reason why this stuff is continuing to happen.

I usually get a follow up email that the pin was reinstated but at this point I have deleted half my boards in the hopes of stopping these false violation notices.

I think the super easy fix is AI generated just have a little thing at the bottom after the pin saying it\u2019s AI generated. I know that\u2019s not the most easy thing to implement but I think it will be well worth it. I dare you type in cozy bedroom to Pinterest none of the pins are real it\u2019s all AI generated photos.

I have found lots of cooking recipes, hacks, and just plain videos that make me laugh! With all that said, after using it for almost a year now I do have one note. The app seems to constantly glitch for me. Sometimes, only on this app, the screen just freezes. I try clicking the back arrow or fiddling around with the buttons but it won\u2019t work. Which means I have to go out of the app, and close the screen. After a couple minutes I go back into the app and it\u2019s completely normal. This frustrates me because if I search up clips and am scrolling through them and found a sequence I like I lose it. (Because it sends you videos that it thinks you\u2019ll like everytime) Besides this one glitch I really enjoy this app, I find myself trying new things and actually being productive with it. It has inspired me to do so many things! Thanks for reading!",

This is VERY upsetting, especially to people who have been on here for over a decade. Another issue I have is a personal one, which is glitchiness. Over the past two years, a lot of glitches have happened, which is really annoying. The most common ones are not being able to scroll the comments and not being able to see my recent pins. Pinterest, please care more about your customers. The majority of us have no ill intentions, we love pinterest to help us with life and creativity. We are not creeps or spammers or WHATEVER.",

When looking for a nursery aesthetic for example, images keep coming up in my feed that I\u2019ve already pinned and guess what? They\u2019ve got about 10 product links in them that prompt you to buy something from various websites. Oh, and it\u2019s way to easy to click said links.

Martin was using a small speaker that could be heard by our very large group, over 40 people. During the introduction Martin stated that he would explore the recent political history as well as the history of the city from the 1500s. Before we began walking, Martin informed us that we were considered live targets for the vehicles in Buenos Aires and therefore we had to keep our heads on a swivel. \n\nDuring the tour, Martin would express factual elements of the political system, as well as the financial issues within the country. When he was speaking about the history of Buenos Aires and the indigenous people, he spoke factually. I appreciate the fact that he was speaking to us with fax, not opinions, but he would express other peoples opinions, both right, and left as written in newspapers. It was very eye-opening for us. The tour was a total of 35 blocks long or 3.5 km or little over 2 miles long. It was a very enjoyable three hour tour. When we stopped for discussions. Martin would always find a shady spot for us. We did have a break during the walk.\n\nOverall, I would give this tour a 5 star rating and highly recommend Martin for this tour.",

Beverly is a gracious hostess and a wonderful cook. Her homemade pumpkin roll is amazing and her eggs and sweet potato hash with turkey sausage and fruit and coffee are wonderful too. Yummy! Everyone staying at Thurston house was delightful to have a conversation with at breakfast. My daughter and I were very comfortable in our incredibly clean and welcoming room. We stayed in the Cubbage room and it was lovely. Thank you, Beverly! We will definitely be back!\u2764\ufe0fWhat a treasure! Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the serene setting on the wrap around porch. Will make sure to stay longer next time.",

    "review_text": "Brayan, Tony, Sopita, Arielle and the female bartender in the lobby bar were great! Resort was run down, almost empty like a ghost town. Which was a blessing and a curse. There\u2019s nothing to do other than Sopita\u2019s activities. Which were fun but even the activity pool was just as quiet as the quiet pool. Most of the shops & restaurants were closed/vacant. Even the market was vacant. There were only 2 places to eat that were part of the all inclusive. Food was mediocre but not that great. The Latitude Vacation Club claims it is because they\u2019ve closed a lot of things for remodeling but members who have been coming here for years said it\u2019s always like this. If you\u2019re looking for quiet and relaxing then this is your place. If you\u2019re looking for an active all inclusive with lots of things to do you\u2019ll be very disappointed! There\u2019s nothing around because of the remoteness of this resort so you either have to taxi, Uber or wait for the shuttle to get anywhere to do anything. Beach is 10 minute shuttle away. Shuttle runs every hour until 5. After that you have to find your own way back. The best thing we did was rent a golf cart to get around the area. Front concierge was not helpful at all with our booked excursions because we didn\u2019t book through her. Told me I could cancel what I bought through Trip Advisor and rebook with her and then she could help me. That was $40 more than what we paid so we kept our packages we got through this site. The Latitude Vacation Club makes you sit through a presentation. They say only 90 minutes but ours lasted 3 hours and 5 minutes before my husband just got up and said we\u2019re leaving. Other people were saying theirs lasted 4-8 hours!! We most likely will never be back to this particular resort.",

Upon arriving at site each step we took was met with excellent guidance and utmost concern for our safety.  The waterfalls were breathtaking and most enjoyable along with our \u201cspa\u201d mud bath.  So rejuvenating \ud83d\ude0a !! Guides offered to take pictures of us enjoying ourselves and relaxing without us ever having to ask (DID I MENTION SO MEMORABLE).  Our lunch was delicious and oh so surreal \u2026 to indulge in a Costa Rican lunch along side the majestic waterfall took one day to make as a memory but it will last a lifetime.

Of you felt its unsafe or your uncomfortable please just bring it back. Offering full refund if it was with a short period of time!  My wife and I chose to move on to the boat and head out underway!   Sometimes the big water can be a bit nerve racking, but we went on over to PizzaPI suggested by the guys.  A bit closer and pretty cool spot.  The weather finally broke and we ended up in Scott Beach area for around 4 hrs and snorkeled and had a great rest of the day!  I thoroughly recommend these two young men and their business!  NO refund required!!   Push on!!   \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01",

It is very frustrating, after being after being rushed through our whole excursion,  that we have to wait over an hour to get out of here.

    "review_text": "Private tours arranged by Jack Sparrow in St. Lucia, West Indies. We stayed at Coconut Bay Beach Resort and Spa. The resort offers tours but they\u2019re group tours and prices can be much higher. \nJack Sparrow is not affiliated with the resort. He\u2019s a licensed tour guide. His office is located on the beach next to the resort. There were 4 in our group. You pick the activities that you want to check out and a driver will pick you up at the resort. Both days we toured, beverages and lunch was provided. Our drivers, Lyndon on our first tour and Calvin the second time were very professional and knowledgeable. They encouraged us to ask questions. The tours began in a small town on the Caribbean side of the island about a 45 minute drive from the resort on the Atlantic side. We boarded a boat to see the bat cave and the Pitons, two huge mountains off the coast, aka \u201cthe boobs\u201d of the island. We went to Sugar Beach. Snorkeling was awesome! Hundreds of types of beautifully colored fish of all kinds. A local serves up the best pi\u00f1a coladas from his small boat at the beach. We also enjoyed the 100 degree mineral bath, then mud bath, let it dry on your skin, our Guide then painted our faces and arms and backs with a black mud. He took pictures for us too. Back in the mineral bath to wash it off. They had showers to rinse off afterwards. Our skin felt amazing after that, soft as a baby\u2019s butt. \nThe last tour included watching the sun set at Black Sand Beach. I was curious about suba divers 10-20 ft out from the shore. The guide told me just like the Pitons that rise straight up from the sea the drop off is just as abrupt and drops a couple thousand feet. Wow! \nPricey? Not at all! For us 4 only $500! Including transportation by car and boat, including lunch, and a wonderful rum punch and soft drinks. The group tour arranged by Coconut Bay ran about $800 for 4. \nJack Sparrow is your man for setting up your amazing tour. You can find him right behind the Jerk Shack, on the beach.",

Everything inspired tranquility and meditation.The pool isn\u2019t available to children under 12 so a temple-like atmosphere is maintained. Everything we saw at the hotel, we saw at various Lanna temples. Most welcome is its elegant and well-appointed library. We loved the restaurant and the pottery, ceramics and art throughout it and the hotel. The service was outstanding; help was available 24 hours a day. It was restorative to stay at Rachamankha.

TripAdvisor turned me down for this review.\n\nBuyer beware!\nViking Cruise Line offers one box to check for travel insurance and TripMate was it.\nUpon enduring a broken hip, my father-in-law was approved for a full refund 6 months ago. He's heard \"checks are lost, being reissued, in the mail, will be there over night...\" all these lies are taking their toll on him. This is elder abuse. He's just so upset. 18K may not be a lot of money for Viking or TripMate, but it is to a senior veteran.\n\nThis was my response to TripAdvisor:\nSo, I will let everyone know that Trip advisor does not want any helpful reviews to assist elderly travelers from falling into scams, therefore, Tripadvisor is not actually an advisory website\u2026 only one that should be known for accepting only superficial fluff on travel experiences. That\u2019s fine\u2026 I will post my reviews on social media and Google from now on.",

Many settings are inaccessible using non-standard controls so I am unable to set up location and other such profile information. So much more is non standard that after hours and hours trying to get a minimum of access I have had to give up on this app totally.

Many settings are inaccessible using non-standard controls so I am unable to set up location and other such profile information. So much more is non standard that after hours and hours trying to get a minimum of access I have had to give up on this app totally.

Previously, while exploring the map, stumbling upon towns, islands, or areas with undiscovered hostels led to exciting new opportunities for me. The current search area functionality feels limiting, causing me to overlook potential places to explore and stay. Restoring the ability to roam and search specific locations would enhance my travel experience and increase bookings for hostel owners. Considering this, I now prefer using Booking.com for its more flexible search options. Reintroducing this user-friendly feature would not only benefit my travel experiences but also contribute to the growth and revenue of Hostelworld.",

They have focused far too much on social \u2018chat\u2019 features which were already present in the old app. Why they have removed the wish list is beyond me. It is not even possible to save, star or favourite an accommodation any more, you have to search it again every time to find it. An appalling update and an appalling decision from Hostelworld developers. A favourite feature is the most basic and crucial part of an app, and it is gone? I hope this finds the developers as soon as possible, it needs to be changed and updated right now.",

I bought something from ebay and still $4.5 left in my account. I tried to close again but it stopped me and warned me to withdraw funds. I just got an email from app that my funds dropped to below 0. Now when I tried to delete it is saying insufficient funds. It doesnt let me close the account.

Any amount of research online will find a litany of anecdotal cases of poor Aussies being scammed out of thousands of dollars with no compensation.

In some respects it is, it allows you to change currencies and withdraw from atms in foreign countries. Not bad if you plan to use it for a couple of holidays a year.\n\nUnfortunately, if you plan to travel long term, a lot of the advertised perks are completely pointless. Such as the cash back rewards. These are only eligible in the country where you first set up the card, and cannot be changed without cancelling the card and selling your portfolio of stocks/crypto/ commodities. \n\nAs for the travel insurance! This is a complete joke and I urge people not to rely on this as medical cover. It would be a great perk to have from Revolut, but the insurance is provided through a 3rd party - \u2018Allianz\u2019, who have so many clauses and loopholes written in to the cover, it is almost guaranteed you will not be able to make a claim when you need to!\n\nIf Revolut can improve this app so it is more applicable for the long term traveller it would be great. Likewise, they really need to be honest with their customers about what a joke the medical cover is. Fortunately I only missed out on a few hundred dollars, but it is not uncommon for medical expenses to really rack up and it is unlikely you would ever see a penny from this Allianz/ Revolut cover.",

The entire hotel is lovely and quiet and cool. I cannot thank the staff enough for their amazing help throughout our stay. The room was a good size for us and was kept cool throughout our stay which given the heat was perfect. Everything is kept spotlessly clean throughout the hotel and the rooms are kept clean and tidy. We will definitely be back!",

I had mailed the company to see if the cruise was going ahead, taking into consideration the weather and the predictions (in every bloody web site going!) there would be 0% chance of seeing the lights.\n\nCruise went ahead and the crew/ guides \u2018kept up\u2019 the myth of seeing the lights\u2026 and we basically just sailed around Tromso island! \n\nBecause we didn\u2019t see the lights, at the end we were offered to come back for another cruise\u2026 but we were going home the next day! \n\nI don\u2019t feel the company was very honourable in not offering the chance to cancel the trip.. or at least give the guests the option, as had another tour company we booked an excursion with.\n\n A waste of money.. couldn\u2019t even see any scenery due to the dark & heavy snow!",

We can see the lake from dining area and have an abundance of ducks,pheasants and little birds including a red breasted nuthatch that visit most days. The shower is super hot and supplied with soft white towels.  It is the most tranquil place I have ever stayed. We are surrounded by woodland and life slows down here. The staff are very helpful, friendly and there if you need them.  Of course we could not stay here and not go to the on site restaurant, but do book to avoid disappointment. We shared the baked Camembert as a starter, it was fabulous and then we had pizza with a thin crispy base along with a lovely bottle of wine.  As someone who is always in the kitchen at home I can never resist going into Julia\u2019s shop, I actually didn\u2019t buy for the kitchen but a knitted hat for me but there is always something to tempt you. It\u2019s probably about 30 minutes by car into Stirling and 20 minutes into Callender where there is a wide river with a seated area and a decent car park. A good selection of shops and cafes and a wonderful bakery line the main road.  We stayed for a week and it\u2019s never long  enough so we are returning next year. Thank you for your hospitality.

However, the manager reserved a room for us until I received a confirmation email.  We were lucky to upgrade to a seaview room, and although it was February, it was well worth it. \nOur room was huge, the beds comfy with starch white linen. We were given a complimentary bottle of Prosecco.  Tea and coffee was in the room. \nWe had a lovely big shower, but no complimentary toiletries, so bring your own. \n The food was ok, I wouldn\u2019t rave about it, except the Sunday roast that was nice and very reasonable. \nThe hotel pool was nice, very quiet during the day. \nA walk into town takes about 20 mins.",

The food was poor quality and overpriced for a local pub!   My friend had to ask for a steak knife which should have been supplied with our cutlery!   Scampi was served with cold peas!  My fish was poor quality and tasteless and chips underneath were just bits !  \nWe tried to get the attention of a waiter who was chatting to his friends on another table to rectify our issues and he was very rude and unhelpful! Which was both embarrassing and upsetting as my friends were visiting!  \nWe spoke to the head waiter when asking for the bill and he apologised but the evening was spoiled,  as the bar area had now filled with people on a poker night!! This hadn\u2019t been mentioned when I booked! \nAt my request we were given a 10%discount off the bill!  This was still more expensive than the meal we had the following evening in a lovely restaurant in centre of York. \nA very disappointing experience for visiting friends\u2026. Take note Black Horse!!  You are not a high end restaurant but a local pub with quiz nights/ music etc and you don\u2019t expect overpriced poor service and food!",

Really great atmosphere, great decor and comfy surroundings.  The staff were knowledgeable and informative.  A trolley of steak was brought to our table to enable us to choose what we wanted with an explanation of each piece.  \nChateaubriand cooked just how we liked it.  Hubby even had a lovely dessert with a firework candle and a photo of us celebrating.  The attention to detail was perfect.  Very thoughtful.  \nThis is a very popular restaurant, it was full and the service was spot on.  We had a fabulous evening.  I would highly recommend.",

    "review_text": "We booked two nights at the Plantation having read such good reviews. However, once we arrived we found the host patronising and unwelcoming. We were not prepared for how many dogs would be on the property (five) and they were aggressive and extremely loud, disturbing the sense of peacefulness amidst nature. \n\nThe pool was lovely, however the cabins were rudimentary at best. Extremely old and uncomfortable bedding with just one pillow, and the whole room looked bleak.  \n\nWhilst it\u2019s not a hotel and we didn\u2019t expect 5* service, we were surprised to see the host watch us drag our bags from the taxi to the cabin without any offer of help. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best, and late served - which was particularly frustrating when they did not have alternative food to order and one-hour meal times were strictly defined in the guest documents. \n\nWe did not appreciate the host trying to hard sell his cashew liquor at every opportunity. He was completely disinterested in his guests, rather spoke at us at length about his business and how tourism is ruining Goa. Ironic,  considering his decision to offer accommodation to tourists. \n\nAlso considering Goa is dark after 6pm, the lighting in our cabins was very poor, which made it very hard to read, and there is absolutely nothing else to do in the evenings (Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t reach the rooms and you are isolated in the forest).\n\nTo top it all off, when we paid for our dinner and drinks, the host failed to return the correct change. If you are looking for an enjoyable stay in Goa, this may not be for you. However, the guide Sam (organised through the host) who took us on a jungle hike to see the waterfall was FANTASTIC and we would highly recommend him. He knew about every single animal, was extremely respectful of nature, and a delight to talk to.",

The food was excellent with plenty of choice fresh meat and Fish each day and excellent service. We were fortunate to be upgraded to a spacious room with large bathroom, balcony overlooking the sea and well kept gardens, also a very comfy bed and good storage. The whole resort was immaculately clean especially the pools and walkways. The entertainment was varied with local music and dancing each night. I would definitely go back and recommend it to family and friends.",

I started with the octupus which was the best I have tasted in the algarve , my wife started with the prawns in a sumptuous sauce which we were advised to add some bread to our order - great idea ! I ended up finishing off my wife\u2019s starter as it was so so good . Mains we both went for the seabass , fish was so white and tender , you could tell it was so fresh . Desert was the homemade apple pie and ice cream , so different to back in England but so tasty .

The bed was a good size, comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed. However\u2026\n\nWe could not turn the central heating off. Even with the window open, and the radiator thermostat turned down, we roasted. Our poor dog ( no water bowl) was especially miserable.\n\nThe food is terrible. Evening meal ( pheasant pie in one case, fish pie the other) was a nasty mush, reheated in a microwave. Not worth \u00a322 each. Breakfast also dire - if you avoided the cooked one, it was a choice of cornflakes or rice Krispies. A scattering of fresh fruit and yoghurt and some small croissants of the supermarket variety not good enough. Coffee barely drinkable.\n\nIt\u2019s a real shame that such a nice place is let down this way. Sort these, and the Bull would be worth a stay.",

It\u2019s a lovely peaceful haven out of the main town- with a lovely walk along the prom to the beach. It\u2019s right on the coast and Promenade and not overlooked by other hotels.  \nIt\u2019s small and friendly - and had everything we wanted.  2 good sized pools, a jacuzzi and a splash pool. There\u2019s a gym and a sauna too.  It\u2019s clean and tidy and the staff are all lovely.  Rooms are bungalows with their own patio, scattered throughout the grounds - very spacious accommodation.  Buffet restaurant. Life here is very relaxing and low key, perfect for chilling out.  \nLooking forward to coming back",

Pillows in room are very soft and squishy. They charge you $80 Fiji dollars to your room and on checkout you take your receipt back to the shop with the pillow and they reverse the charge. Our flight leaves so early she\u2019s not open so you just take to reception with your receipt and they can do the reversal there as well. It is a nice extra benefit of staying here.

The food provided at the hotel is exceptional. The buffet breakfast includes genuine Vietnamese dishes and a chef who is ready to cook a fresh omelet upon your request. The hotel has the exclusive right to take its customers on a complimentary tour of a volcanic natural cave. My friends and I were fortunate enough to be taken to the first chamber of the cave by the kind manager, followed by a professional tour guid taking us to an adventure inside the cave. \nThe hotel manager is professional, friendly and passionate about serving customers. Even the Vietnam Tourism Minister chose to stay at this hotel while we were there, which highlights the hotel's exclusivity at a very reasonable price, perhaps half the cost of an average hotel in Hanoi.\nRegarding my personal experience, I had to stay at this hotel due to my individual circumstances. However, the understanding and care shown by the hotel manager and the assistant manager made me feel like a family member, and I will always be grateful to them. \nI am confident that you will enjoy your stay in this hotel and have a wonderful time in Mai Chau.",

The entire trip was seamless. \n\nThe best part of the trip was Brayan/our English speaking guide. He had all the required skill sets, he is passionate about what he does. Most importantly he knew where and when to take photos. Without him, the trip would have been totally different I would say. Special thanks to Brayan. His English and knowledge about the place was top end. \n\nThe tour co-ordinator/ Lic.Irwin Jesus was extremely prompt in answering all my questions. He has great level of patience for sure.",

The site and the structures are simply amongst the most magnificent on earth. The pictures in books cannot replace the views from the heights of Athens ( no buildings are allowed anywhere near the height of the Acropolis) and cannot reveal the timelessness and sense of history thick in the air. The constant repair of damage done by the Persians and many others, including failed restoration projects by the Greeks since the 1800s, cannot remove the extraordinary vibe of this ancient seat of great glory and mysterious Gods and great leaders and rulers. The seamless tourist process was very good although we were not offered headphones and an auditory guide which would have been appreciated. The signposting leaves a little to be desired in terms of available options and must have been obstructed by the large crowds.",

Lunch was served, a selection of 5 delicious Thai dishes plus all the fruit you could eat. We stopped to snorkel at Koh Ma , a beautiful cove framed by golden sands. My husband said the fish and coral were beautiful. We set sail again heading to Koh Phangan where we had a choice of massages, walks along the beach or drinks at the bar.

The food was delicious, we shared the croquettes and I had the supreme of chicken and my husband the pork - both exceptionally tasty and generous portions, with different vegetable accompaniements, not the same vegetables on each plate that we have encountered in both France and Italy.  The waiters were friendly, attentive and professional and had great senses of humour and fantastic English without being condescending.  All in all a great experience exceeding our expectations.

Keeps me money conscious and not anxious. \n\nAlso love their spare change option, has helped me safe money in case things have gotten rough monetary wise and it has. \n\n10/10 recommend to anyone who travels a lot.",

I deleted the app and after redownloading it, it doesn\u2019t allow me to open the app, just keeps saying to try again later no matter how many times I try to redownload it.\nThe worst part is they don\u2019t have a contact number and say if you want to contact someone to do it via the app which, as stated previously, will not allow me to enter so complete waste of my time.",

    "review_text": "I got this app because it was recommended to me for international travel. I opted for the Premium plan and ordered a chromatic card which was around $20 or so.\n\nThree weeks later, the card has not arrived. So I proceeded to try to reach customer service via chat which is a perk of the Premium plan. Low and behold, there is no customer service live chat feature in their help bar so you have to wait for a response email from an inexistent support team. Even after sending an email, common protocol is to receive a confirmation email. However, Revolut doesn\u2019t have that, meaning your message may or may not have reached them. No way of knowing. \n\nAlso, be aware that there is no phone number to call. For a bank in the United States to not have a customer service phone number is a huge red flag.\n\nIf you have funds left in the app, there is no way to withdraw them without having the card, which once again they didn\u2019t send. So, essentially you are stuck having money in a mysterious bank account without any customer support and you watch it get drained by the monthly premium fees. Another huge red flag.\n\nIf you terminate the premium plan early, they charge $19.98. So basically, you pay $20 for a card and $19.98 for early termination of premium plan, you cannot get your money back and you have no way to speak to somebody in order to get help. Imagine getting stuck in a foreign country being at the mercy of Revolut - it would be a total nightmare! This is a total SCAM so please do not fall for this. \n\nI am reporting this company to the FDIC. I hope this helps any of you readers to avoid getting scammed like I did.",

The thing that pisses me off the most is if someone REQUESTS money the app says \"YoU OwE\"... no I don't \"owe them\" anything that's just how much the person requested and it makes it seem like I'm in debt towards that person.
