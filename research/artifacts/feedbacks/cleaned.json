Only now after the best part of 4 years has the battery finally given up on me, and I think it\u2019s time I retire them. My replacement being another Tozo pair, as they have been fantastic.\nI could not recommend them enough. I am writing this review the day they finally died, but do not less this dissuade you.

We chose to stay in a canopy villa, essentially a treehouse accessible by either a ramp, or a tall staircase. The rooms are luxurious and incredibly comfortable. The beach is beautiful a little rocky, and it was pretty windy when we were her.  the pool is not heated but very refreshing and a beautiful place to watch the sunset. We did their sunset hike to get a 360 of all the islands around and that really was beautiful. The hike is not for those out of shape. we met some amazing people, and saw lots of families enjoying their time. \n\nAre only criticism would be the food. When we first arrived, it was \u00e0 la cart, which was unbelievable the best ceviche I\u2019ve ever had. However, when it got busy, they switched to only buffet at lunch and dinner which became pretty boring by night 4. in addition, nothing on the buffet was ever hot. Furthermore, a great choice for  Eggs in the morning -made  fresh for you, but again, but often arrived to the table, lukewarm and sometimes cool. \n\nOne tip we only learned about the last day was if you don\u2019t want buffet at lunch you can always order \u00e0 la cart from the pool bar!"

Quality drama from many countries and cultures and in their native languages (subtitles). Only BBC iPlayer is better for series. And Free.\n\nDocumentaries are non-existent,  so don't expect to improve your mind\n\nThe main gripe I have is the films. There ARE films on there worth your time watching. But very few of them. The majority are dire chewing gum for the eyes to entertain the undiscerning. \n\nFormulaic, repetitive plotlines, low budget, unknown cast, predictive plot lines. If I want to watch a film I always have better success with Film 4, or there's TPTV for the true classics. \nIf you try searching for a film 80% of the time you get a \"we don't have that, try this load of Straight-to-DVD crap\".\n\nI've got a few months left on my contract, then I will review.

Good size, and super easy to put on. should take you less than a minute to put it on and the same to take it off. Comes with a little pouch for storage when not in use. The reflective orange things are to let you know the direction you should install (front). It sturdy, didn\u2019t move even after the windy night we had and water slips right off or it when it rain.\nOnly thing I don\u2019t like is the grey color it has inside.

It comes with reusable silverware and the color choices are cute. The price was also very reasonable. Unfortunately, my kids have had issues with these and we've had to replace them more than once. We have broken the locking tabs on the side, we have had things leak into other compartments because the seal wasn't tight, we have snapped the lid to the silverware compartment clean off, etc. Now, I understand that some of these things are definitely due to my kids being too rough and that's fine. I wasn't expecting these to last more than 1 school year anyway.  But it would have been nice if it was a little sturdier.  Regardless, my kids absolutely loved them and insisted I buy replacements. Just know that if your child is rough on things, this will not last you long."

Me ofrecieron una lista de barcos, categor\u00eda B, y luego me convencieron para pagar un suplemento para optar a la categor\u00eda C mand\u00e1ndome otra lista de barcos. Una vez analizados los barcos que me pod\u00edan tocar en la opci\u00f3n C acepto el recargo. Unos d\u00edas antes del viaje me avisan del barco que me han asignado y no est\u00e1 ni en la lista B ni en la lista C. Yo investigo un poco y en otras webs lo catalogan como A (la peor categor\u00eda posible). El Corte Ingl\u00e9s se desentendi\u00f3, la comercial no quiso hacer nada, ni me devolvieron dinero, no me buscaron otro barco y ni me dieron explicaciones.

    "content": "If you are looking for a holiday in Goa, this may not be for you\nWe booked two nights at the Plantation having read such good reviews. However, once we arrived we found the host patronising and unwelcoming. We were not prepared for how many dogs would be on the property (five) and they were aggressive and extremely loud, disturbing the sense of peacefulness amidst nature. \n\nThe pool was lovely, however the cabins were rudimentary at best. Extremely old and uncomfortable bedding with just one pillow, and the whole room looked bleak.  \n\nWhilst it\u2019s not a hotel and we didn\u2019t expect 5* service, we were surprised to see the host watch us drag our bags from the taxi to the cabin without any offer of help. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best, and late served - which was particularly frustrating when they did not have alternative food to order and one-hour meal times were strictly defined in the guest documents. \n\nWe did not appreciate the host trying to hard sell his cashew liquor at every opportunity. He was completely disinterested in his guests, rather spoke at us at length about his business and how tourism is ruining Goa. Ironic,  considering his decision to offer accommodation to tourists. \n\nAlso considering Goa is dark after 6pm, the lighting in our cabins was very poor, which made it very hard to read, and there is absolutely nothing else to do in the evenings (Wi-Fi doesn\u2019t reach the rooms and you are isolated in the forest).\n\nTo top it all off, when we paid for our dinner and drinks, the host failed to return the correct change. If you are looking for an enjoyable stay in Goa, this may not be for you. However, the guide Sam (organised through the host) who took us on a jungle hike to see the waterfall was FANTASTIC and we would highly recommend him. He knew about every single animal, was extremely respectful of nature, and a delight to talk to."

It takes a few seconds to load anything in the app which can be extremely annoying when just checking things quickly. Lots of performance issues. When you open up a page of who is staying at your hostel, it must try and load every single person in the list at once rather than lazy loading. So, when I try to view a list of the 80 people staying at my hostel, the app freezes for a good 30 seconds before even showing the list. The messaging functionality is also extremely buggy and every chat is filled with \u201cIs anyone else solo traveling?\u201d, followed by a message like \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to send that\u201d because everyone accidentally hits the quick chat things."

    "content": "life is good\nUnboxing & Design: Standard unboxing, nothing extraordinary. The laptop feels solid, thanks to the unibody aluminum build. Love that ports are back!, but I'm really not a fan of the webcam notch \u2013 a larger top bezel or a different design would be better. The space black finish is nice, it appears more like a gunmetal grey in bright light, but in low light or oblique angles it is very black.\nPerformance: Scores well on geekbench, and cinebench. I haven't had any issues with performance, and vs my old base M1 macbook pro 8gb, its much much harder to summon the beach ball! Apple's gaming claims are a bit overhyped, or premature tho... there's hardly any, and running games through Crossover is okay. Compatibility and performance are ymmv for sure. Get a gaming laptop if you want to game.\nDisplay: The Full array micro led backlight really helps HDR pop on this, and colors are fantastic. But in dark images with small bright highlights you can see some backlight blooming. 120hz refresh is always welcome, but know that macbook displays usually have pretty bad pixel response times so fast moving content tends to blur. Apple should move to OLED displays, this would fix their pixel response and backlight blooming.\nMemory & Storage: 18GB RAM does the job well, even for AI model stuff (stable diffusion, up to 13b llama models). The 1TB SSD is adequate, though I would've liked more without the Apple tax... Performance-wise, it's comparable to high-end PCIE4 M.2 NVMe drives.\nBattery & Charging: Battery life is good, lasts all day for light tasks, but anything that uses rosetta translation or gpu drains it much faster. Magsafe is great to have back, but the magnet feels too strong - worried it might damage the port or finish over time.\nValue: At $2400, it feels a bit overpriced. It's a solid buy for those upgrading from older Macs or Apple enthusiasts. If you're thinking of gaming on this, look elsewhere despite apple's recent boasting. Also, I miss Bootcamp - would been great to have the ARM version of Windows on this."

Xcaret - Arte\nAdvice, tips and pointers\nIf you plan on hitting any of the parks like the ziplines or the ATV rides take the 8:30AM bus to them from Arte. You will be close to the front of the line, you\u2019ll see that because by the time you get to the end of each of those rides some will already be closed because the lines are full. \nIf you\u2019re planning on going to the Xcaret park go Mon - Fri if you can - Sat and Sun are a zoo. If you like birds then you must go to the bird sanctuary - it\u2019s hard to describe but you are following a path from top to bottom in a circular fashion bit doesn\u2019t feel like it. There are nets over the top of the exhibit but you don\u2019t notice them and all of the birds are flying free - except the bald eagle and the condor. At each level on the path there are boulders that tell you what birds you can expect to see. And then it just goes on - there are maps there that you can look at to see what you would like to see most. This park can\u2019t be done in one day!! Come here at night and watch the Mexican Show - the first half explains the culture of Mexico and the second half celebrates the different states/provinces of Mexico.\nIf you only have one week look at what you\u2019d enjoy the most and plan your time. You don\u2019t want to miss the best of what you want to see."

The captain was entertaining and extremely knowledgeable relative to the movie with Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn. He was not only knowledgeable about the movie, but with personal information about the stars of the movie as well. It was fun especially when the ladies on board each did a reenactment of the scene where Katharine Hepburn poured a bottle of gin overboard while holding an umbrella with a perfect look of sustain on her face. The captain had wonderful black and white pictures of the stars in the movie. The tour was fun and since the passengers are limited to between 4 to 6, you got to know and have conversations with each other. And folks, the boat in which we took the cruise is the original African Queen used in the movie!!!  Enjoy!\u2764\ufe0f"

I could nicely fit a whole sandwich along with 2 clementine tangerines and grapes... AWESOME! The center area is perfect for salad dressing if you have a small salad or some carrot sticks. The silicone ring keeps it leak proof and has a nice snug fit once you snap on the lid. I like the compartments that separate everything as I don't like my food getting \"mixed up\" with each other while transporting. With that said, if it's good enough for this adult... it'll be great for kids! I highly recommend!"

    "content": "MBP 14 vs Alienware M16\nWell, I ended up buying both this Macbook Pro and an Alienware M16, since both were on sale for BF 2023. The intention is to only keep the one that works the best for me, if any.\nHere is the Alienware M16 config: i7, nVidia RTX 4060, 16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, 16\" Quad HD+ 165Hz screen, 7.2 lbs, $1250.\nPrice: Alienware is roughly $600 cheaper, so it has the initial advantage here, but price is not necessarily the most critical element.\nWeight: The Mac weighs half of what the M16 does and that makes a huge difference if you plan to carry it around. Interestingly enough, the MBP is barely heavier than the Macbook Air 15 M2.\nOS: There is no comparison here. MacOS is superior in each and every way, from privacy, to ease of use. It also comes with free Office applications. For my use, I find these to be as good if not better than Microsoft Office, but don't expect Numbers to work with complex functions or spreadsheets.\nGaming: This is limited on the Mac, but Steam and GOG have plenty of older Mac games that work great. Fallout, Indiana Jones, Baldurs Gate, just a few examples. However, for latest games, there is no contest here, Alienware can play anything, although in a 1080p config.\nBattery Life: The MBP easily wins this one, with almost 2x the battery life. I get around 4-6 hours on the Alienware and 8-12 on the Mac. The Alienware is noisier because it has to run the fan more often.\nScreen: 16\" is my ideal screen size, but 14\" is not bad either. When displaying a static image, the Mac looks more vibrant. It also helps it's significantly brighter. However - the devil is in the details, as I will explain below.\nScreen Response Time: Alienware is 10x faster than the Mac. Is the Mac bad? It really depends on what you plan to use it for, but for a product called 'Pro', a screen response as slow as an iPad is disappointing.\nPWM (Pulse Width Modulation): Alienware and Apple have completely different approaches here. Apple went for a cheap display that has pwm flickering. If you are sensitive to pwm, you will get nausea, dizziness and headaches. I had these within 20 minutes of using this. There is no flickering on the Alienware.\nTemporal Dithering: There is none on the Alienware. I am not sure if the MBP has it, but Apple tends to use cheap 8bit displays that have to fake having billions of colors, so would expect they did it here too. The symptom you would get is that your eyes are burning. My eyes feel this way, but it could also be due to the much higher brightness on the Mac and my eyes still adjusting to it. Apple doesn't allow turning off neither pwm nor temporal dithering.\nValue: While I don't necessarily associate value with price, $600 can buy me a PS5, with a game and extra controller. It's not a small difference. But the deal breaker for me is having to use a screen that will get me feel sick. Most PC manufacturers like Dell/Alienware, Asus, Lenovo, etc have decided to not use pwm and temporal dithering in their laptops, but Apple continues to charge an arm and a leg for cheap display panels. Even if you are not getting headaches from pwm, the long term impact of that constant flickering in our eyes is not known. In my case, it made no sense to me to pay that much more for an inferior product. Good news is that the Macbook Air M2 doesn't have any of these issues, so I may still give that a try.\nI am rating the MBP 2* and the Alienware 3* (too heavy to carry around, poor battery life, Windows OS that can pop-up ads on my screen, no free Office application). I will definitely return the MBP, but probably also the Alienware and get a MBA 15\" M2 instead."

Gave Netflix a ring to explain how unfair this is and they say I cannot go back to \u00a37.99.  Spoke to a manager but he did not care just said nothing we can do but admitted they have no way of knowing if this ad plan will be compatible with your tv.  DISGUSTING, seems like this is a way to get their customers to change to a plan that does not work then charge an extra \u00a33 a month when they try to revert back to a plan you have had for 10 years.  Wish I could give them a minus, so angry, total rip-off, so bye bye Netflix, not that they care."

It has a Tardis-like feel as rooms extend back into a lovely wisteria clad courtyard (which does pizzas in summer). The staff are young and warmly welcoming and it accepts dogs. The bed was a good size, comfortable, and the bathroom well appointed. However\u2026\n\nWe could not turn the central heating off. Even with the window open, and the radiator thermostat turned down, we roasted. Our poor dog ( no water bowl) was especially miserable.\n\nThe food is terrible. Evening meal ( pheasant pie in one case, fish pie the other) was a nasty mush, reheated in a microwave. Not worth \u00a322 each. Breakfast also dire - if you avoided the cooked one, it was a choice of cornflakes or rice Krispies. A scattering of fresh fruit and yoghurt and some small croissants of the supermarket variety not good enough. Coffee barely drinkable.\n\nIt\u2019s a real shame that such a nice place is let down this way. Sort these, and the Bull would be worth a stay."

Read any of the 5 star reviews and they are sus, giving no actual detail of this app. I hope one person finds this and is a lawyer who can help take companies like this down. They target children under 18 to save their money while taking a cut. This app is a breeding group for scammers and an easy way for Revolt to have zero liability if something does go wrong. Any amount of research online will find a litany of anecdotal cases of poor Aussies being scammed out of thousands of dollars with no compensation. Honestly open up a bank account with an of the big four and they offer excatly the same seevice. CMC markets even. What does Revolut do that is different? Is your money safe with this company? Your money probably be safer with the defaulted Lehman Brothers bank than this company."

So my money is been on the platform since October 2023. I have given up, I\u2019m moving the money to global 66. It\u2019s such a shame, I thought I could have a bank online that could be used in both countries, but I guess we are still not quite there yet.

This backpack has so many pockets and space and storage areas. Even a car keychain clip inside! I thought that was pretty cool. The padding on the back of it really makes it comfortable to wear, even for extended periods of time. Like I had stated above, I do need to be wearing a backpack for a lot of my day and my old one would make my shoulders and back hurt. But even with many heavy things inside of it, this backpack is still comfortable! All and all, I genuinely love this backpack and I recommend it to anyone who\u2019s is considering buying it!"

Maybe it's my feet that are the problem, but they were much too wide for my foot so they looked very awkward on. They were the right length, but the width was weird. Also, the material was plastic-like and they looked cheap. However, I was able to do easy dances in them. They're bearable (you get what you pay for)."

    "content": "Ghost Town with nice staff\nBrayan, Tony, Sopita, Arielle and the female bartender in the lobby bar were great! Resort was run down, almost empty like a ghost town. Which was a blessing and a curse. There\u2019s nothing to do other than Sopita\u2019s activities. Which were fun but even the activity pool was just as quiet as the quiet pool. Most of the shops & restaurants were closed/vacant. Even the market was vacant. There were only 2 places to eat that were part of the all inclusive. Food was mediocre but not that great. The Latitude Vacation Club claims it is because they\u2019ve closed a lot of things for remodeling but members who have been coming here for years said it\u2019s always like this. If you\u2019re looking for quiet and relaxing then this is your place. If you\u2019re looking for an active all inclusive with lots of things to do you\u2019ll be very disappointed! There\u2019s nothing around because of the remoteness of this resort so you either have to taxi, Uber or wait for the shuttle to get anywhere to do anything. Beach is 10 minute shuttle away. Shuttle runs every hour until 5. After that you have to find your own way back. The best thing we did was rent a golf cart to get around the area. Front concierge was not helpful at all with our booked excursions because we didn\u2019t book through her. Told me I could cancel what I bought through Trip Advisor and rebook with her and then she could help me. That was $40 more than what we paid so we kept our packages we got through this site. The Latitude Vacation Club makes you sit through a presentation. They say only 90 minutes but ours lasted 3 hours and 5 minutes before my husband just got up and said we\u2019re leaving. Other people were saying theirs lasted 4-8 hours!! We most likely will never be back to this particular resort."

If you get unlucky and something happens, don\u2019t count on them, even if you\u2019re a loyal customer. Twice they let me down. The first: a hostel asked me to email them my card info before arrival despite making a deposit through Hostelworld. I\u2019ve stayed at dozens of hostels and was never asked for my card info prior to arrival. It seemed suspicious, so I asked them to have HostelWorld notify me directly if an action is needed. Instead, they canceled my reservation a few days before I arrived and HostelWorld wouldn\u2019t refund my deposit. I had to book another place for 2x the price due to short notice. Second: Myself and two others were robbed within 1 week in the same hostel. I was robbed twice. The reception could have been more helpful by looking at hallway footage but said it would take too long! I left a factual & honest review for the hostel, warning others of the theft in respectful language, and HostelWorld deleted my review."

    "content": "Astonishing\nPinterest is one of the apps that I\u2019ve had for the longest, it is also an app that will remain on my phone and future for a while. It\u2019s so useful for practically anything. From hairstyles,makeup, diy, fashion, trendy, to videos and pictures of careers, school work etc. For anyone who hasn\u2019t got Pinterest I\u2019d HIGHLY recommend it. \nIt\u2019s a place to go for tips and info that quick and easy and even aesthetic. You can pin your favourites and create a board- and with the new update you can now add notes and separate your boards in sections, for all the kings and queens who love organising. \n\n I especially like how they added a feature for hairstyles where you can search my hair type so all my curly and wavy queens and kings can easily search without having to scroll through pictures of hairstyles that don\u2019t apply to their hair. So amazing!! \n\nOne suggestion I have for Pinterest is for those who have had Pinterest for a while so now have 70+ boards. I would love to be able to pin my board names to the search: So say you found this cute pin of a bedroom inspo idea, but you have boards where ones aesthetic rooms yet your other is rooms that- like a list of things you want to get for your room in pins. When you find that pin and press save, sometimes it doesn\u2019t show up as one of the top 3 boards- so you proceed scrawling through for me 140 boards from A to Z. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change- just to have some boards pinned to the top that I can order to make it easier when I\u2019m pinning a picture! \nThank you so much creators of Pinterest I do enjoy the app is is absolutely miraculous. Have a blessing day.\n\nUpdate: the new update is sooo cool!! Being able to create collages is amazing, normally when making a vision board it\u2019s very time consuming- but now it\u2019s all on the app! And you can download your finished collage and set it as a wallpaper if you like\ud83c\udf80\u2728\ud83e\ude77"

Hostelworld typically doesn\u2019t seem to include taxes and (usually more importantly) fees. So even though you may think you\u2019ve already fully paid, you\u2019ll often need to pay more once you try to check in. It\u2019s never been more than like 30% extra or so of your initial price, but that\u2019s still significant and I don\u2019t understand why Hostelworld can\u2019t include that in the price you pay through the app, or at least SHOW the full price you\u2019ll actually pay when you\u2019re comparing hostels. (Note that I\u2019m not even talking about those classic scummy spots that charge you extra for sheets once you get there, even though, there too, I feel like Hostelworld should be able to indicate that in the itemized bill, or a notice as you check out that that will be the case). Point is, I wish Hostelworld would crackdown on the shady practices of SOME, though not all, hostels on the app."

    "content": "Free walking tour with martin\nWe met our tour guide, Martin, at the opera house. At exactly 10:30 Martin gave us an introduction. Martin was using a small speaker that could be heard by our very large group, over 40 people. During the introduction Martin stated that he would explore the recent political history as well as the history of the city from the 1500s. Before we began walking, Martin informed us that we were considered live targets for the vehicles in Buenos Aires and therefore we had to keep our heads on a swivel. \n\nDuring the tour, Martin would express factual elements of the political system, as well as the financial issues within the country. When he was speaking about the history of Buenos Aires and the indigenous people, he spoke factually. I appreciate the fact that he was speaking to us with fax, not opinions, but he would express other peoples opinions, both right, and left as written in newspapers. It was very eye-opening for us. The tour was a total of 35 blocks long or 3.5 km or little over 2 miles long. It was a very enjoyable three hour tour. When we stopped for discussions. Martin would always find a shady spot for us. We did have a break during the walk.\n\nOverall, I would give this tour a 5 star rating and highly recommend Martin for this tour."

The food was poor quality and overpriced for a local pub!   My friend had to ask for a steak knife which should have been supplied with our cutlery!   Scampi was served with cold peas!  My fish was poor quality and tasteless and chips underneath were just bits !  \nWe tried to get the attention of a waiter who was chatting to his friends on another table to rectify our issues and he was very rude and unhelpful! Which was both embarrassing and upsetting as my friends were visiting!  \nWe spoke to the head waiter when asking for the bill and he apologised but the evening was spoiled,  as the bar area had now filled with people on a poker night!! This hadn\u2019t been mentioned when I booked! \nAt my request we were given a 10%discount off the bill!  This was still more expensive than the meal we had the following evening in a lovely restaurant in centre of York. \nA very disappointing experience for visiting friends\u2026. Take note Black Horse!!  You are not a high end restaurant but a local pub with quiz nights/ music etc and you don\u2019t expect overpriced poor service and food!"

Link it with a phone and you have all of your convosations there that will load quickly. Updates weren't a problem for me and I found it easy and simple to use. You have more features then you have in other standerd apps plus if you like you can slightly customize you backgrounds and sounds for notifications. Overall a great app that you should try out."

I particularly like the space for dipping sauce, and the inclusion of all three utensils. The utensils are well made themselves. I also like the subtle variations within the color scheme applied to the various components.\nSo far it seems to hold up well in the microwave and dishwasher. In our early uses, the dipping sauce has stayed mostly contained during travel. A few specks of sauce may make it into the other compartments but it is tolerable so far and doesn't escape the overall box.\nThe containers really are extra deep for a higher capacity. I got this for my preschool-aged kids and I don't think they really need the extra capacity yet. The size seems to be more suited to an elementary kid or beyond. Still it may be helpful for certain rounder items like a piece of fruit.\nOverall these seem very strong, however I am concerned about a few weak spots. The side flaps seem like the kind of thing which could weaken or come off after extensive use. Also the lid that constrains the utensils has a very small plastic peg that keeps it closed. This peg seems like it could be a weak spot as well. So far these are just speculative concerns, so not a penalty just sharing my perspective. These may also be a reason to use these more with older kids who can take care of them."

Incierto porque compraba 2 perfumes y una crema, m\u00e1s un champ\u00fa y acondicionador de parafarmacia, un total de 300 euros.. y cuando viene la encargada lo empeora, d\u00e1ndole la raz\u00f3n a la empleada y dej\u00e1ndome avergonzada como si estuviera mendigando un neceser.

The cover might work for travel if you had some netting to go over the cover & rack to hold the cover in place and keep it from blowing.

Now I just discovered Netflix has been charging my credit card additionally for the fee for my previous account.  This only shows up on my credit card, not anywhere in my Netflix account.  I have called and done online chat with Netflix and they cannot see those additional charges even though when I put in a dispute through my credit card company, they claimed these additional charges were valid.  Netflix are not to be trusted.  They are crooks."

As we expected, she was warm, welcoming and efficient, and is ready to help. \n\nWe had a 2-person suite with a well-equipped kitchenette, an European laundry and a bathroom. The room was serviced Monday to Saturday. The cleaning crew was well mannered and kept the place in top shape. \n\nThe Wilson carpark is adjacent with direct access from the Quest. Guests are required to book at a daily cost. \n\nThere is a cafe (with excellent coffee and food) and a bar downstairs and a convenience store across the road. \n\nWe\u2019ve enjoyed our 2-week stay here and will highly recommend this place."

The entire trip was seamless. \n\nThe best part of the trip was Brayan/our English speaking guide. He had all the required skill sets, he is passionate about what he does. Most importantly he knew where and when to take photos. Without him, the trip would have been totally different I would say. Special thanks to Brayan.

Desde el primer momento me saludo de una manera muy agradable, por lo que nada mas entrar, me hizo sentirme muy agusto, asi que aproveche ( despues de darme una vueta por la tienda, ya que nunca habia estado alli) le pedi por favor si me podria ayudar, a lo cual, muy amablemente me ayudo desde el primer momento, me explicaba cada producto, se interesaba en todo momento para que tipo de persona era, me aconsejaba y me asesoraba e incluso termino asesorandome con productos que me lleve para mi tambien. Hacia tiempo que no encontraba a un gran profesional, asi que desde aqui le doy las gracias por su dedicacion, su amabilidad y su gran asesoramiento. Por supuesto volvere. Muchas gracias Wen."

I admittedly don't know a lot about dance shoes, but I they should fit a bit tighter. So I reordered in a 6.5. To my dismay, the 6.5 was only tighter around the ankle and was noticeably bigger everywhere else. I'm planning on keeping the 7 since I think the shoes are good quality.

The \"minimum\" fee is $20 which is outrageous in my opinion because if someone only needed $5 per say I have to take out an extra $20 just to send it which is stupid. The thing that pisses me off the most is if someone REQUESTS money the app says \"YoU OwE\"... no I don't \"owe them\" anything that's just how much the person requested and it makes it seem like I'm in debt towards that person. Terrible app do no recommend, download any other money app but this one"

The chalets are lovely, super cosy and have everything you need, especially in the kitchen including a washer/tumble dryer. We can see the lake from dining area and have an abundance of ducks,pheasants and little birds including a red breasted nuthatch that visit most days. The shower is super hot and supplied with soft white towels.  It is the most tranquil place I have ever stayed. We are surrounded by woodland and life slows down here. The staff are very helpful, friendly and there if you need them.  Of course we could not stay here and not go to the on site restaurant, but do book to avoid disappointment. We shared the baked Camembert as a starter, it was fabulous and then we had pizza with a thin crispy base along with a lovely bottle of wine.  As someone who is always in the kitchen at home I can never resist going into Julia\u2019s shop, I actually didn\u2019t buy for the kitchen but a knitted hat for me but there is always something to tempt you. It\u2019s probably about 30 minutes by car into Stirling and 20 minutes into Callender where there is a wide river with a seated area and a decent car park. A good selection of shops and cafes and a wonderful bakery line the main road.  We stayed for a week and it\u2019s never long  enough so we are returning next year. Thank you for your hospitality. Anne and Andrew"

There are times when the sensitivity of these earbuds may be slightly higher than you'd like and times where it might register 1 tap instead of 2. For the quality of sound. I'd say that it's absolutely excellent for its price and maybe even worth more that what its priced at. The bass is quite heavy but it does sound a bit muddy.

I used to go to Pinterest as an escape and to have a calm time looking through pretty pictures and making mood boards. Now, I can\u2019t scroll a single centimeter without seeing an ad pop up, and it\u2019s absolutely infuriating because the ads are so jarring compared to the rest of my feed that it actually hurts my brain. They are an eye sore. At first I thought I could just ignore it, but the more I see the ads, the less I want to go on Pinterest. It\u2019s horrendous, please fix this. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t have any ads, but make them sparse. Also I want pictures, I\u2019m not looking for products. This beautiful app I used to love has become so awful to use now, I get the same pictures all the time, the niche content I\u2019m looking for is always so difficult to look up, I could go on and on. Pinterest please fix this as a loyal and loving user. Amen."

Estando en casa me puse a mirar viajes vi un crucero muy interesante de costa cruceros a un precio interesante tambi\u00e9n, al ver que era por el corte ingl\u00e9s ped\u00ed presupuesto y al d\u00eda siguiente me llamaron. Me atendi\u00f3 una chica super maja, ella se ofreci\u00f3 a todo a mandarme p\u00e1ginas para coger las excursiones mas baratas, me llamaba a todas horas me enviaba correos con otras ofertas entonces decid\u00ed reservar con ella ojo!!!! Con ella!!!! Me lo puso todo tan f\u00e1cil me dijo que cualquier duda con el check in ella me lo solucionaba que si tenia dudas sobre el barco la llamase la llamase? Donde? Si una vez que as pagado y ya tienes la reserva nunca mas puedes volver a hablar con el departamentos de reservas ni contestan a los correos ya as pagado y adios muy buenas!!!!! Lo mas fuerte que despu\u00e9s te pasan a otro departamento si tienes alguna duda en el cual no saben nada ni explicarte como va el tema del seguro de viaje que tambien hemos contratado con ellos ni cambiarte la hora del check in, que nos hubiera gustado cambiarla ya que lleg\u00e1bamos muy temprano un tal alvaro me cogio el tel\u00e9fono me atendi\u00f3 fatal no me soluciono nada entonces decido llamar a costa cruceros y me llevo la sorpresa de que me dicen: Usted a reservado con una agencia de viajes ante cualquier duda ellos se hacen cargo nosotros no podemos ayudarle!!!!!! Para mi experiencia nunca mas con viajes el corte ingl\u00e9s y mucho menos por la venta tel\u00e9fonica una pena pero esa a sido mi experiencia solo me toca esperar a que alguien me contacte y me pueda solucionar las dudas ya que salimos de Cruceros en 20 dias"

I reported this to Revolut and instead of investigating they asked to see them even though I clearly explained they were unrelated to me and I had no access to them Revolut then blocked my account? Punished for being honest I guess? \n After inquiring about this for several weeks\u2026 I received a termination of account email\u2026 \nWhen I inquired on twitter they refused to tell me why and said that if continued to pester them they block my twitter\u2026 \nSo for being one of revoluts first customer and for being honest.. and being related to the victim of a scam.. for asking questions and wanting to access my legally obtained money after several months of customer service conversations\u2026.

These arrived a day before the Sony earbuds so she opened them and liked them so much she opted to not even open the Sony pair.  She has been using them for about 2.5 months and still is very happy.

Their artificial intelligence mistakes items for something they are not, such as a candle holder. You get a message in regards to your listening being deleted and prohibited, they send u a list of items that are ok to sell and it will list candle holder as an ok item. You appeal the decision and get yet another automatic response with a persons name on the bottom stating it\u2019s a prohibited item. Totally disregarding the fact it\u2019s a picture of candle holders, u state it\u2019s a candle holder and then they call u a liar and delete it. The id verification is a scam. They ask you to up load your drivers license, they verify it with a confirmation message stating it\u2019s successful . Then two weeks later they send you a message banding your ability to withdraw your money from your wallet due to not verifying your identity. You message them and they send you automatic reply stating you didn\u2019t verify your identity correctly. If that\u2019s the case then why send a confirmation message saying it\u2019s successful. To me it seems like they are scamming people and selling the personal information on the black market if they are continuing to ask for your id and social security number. I used to love this app. Now I\u2019m going to contact lifelock and make sure they aren\u2019t stealing my identity.

Not saying this to boast, but to indicate that I\u2019ve got the experience with MN to make some observations. Overall, the platform is very good. I\u2019m not certain that I would have chosen MN if I\u2019d known four years ago what I know now. My #1 complaint is that MN absolutely sucks at informing hosts of networks about things that matter. Case in point: I just found out that there was an update for the app when I opened the App Store. My #2 grumble is that MN constantly has glitches. There\u2019s never not something that\u2019s not working as it should. #3 MN is 100% committed to getting hosts to spend more money. These three are intertwined. When we launched on MN, the staff seemed to be interested in helping hosts build enduring communities. That all changed a couple of years ago when they started to focus on getting hosts to upgrade to increasingly expensive plans, buying \u201cCommunity Building,\u201d courses, and making ridiculous claims about how easy it was to make buckets of money. For example, \u201csix figure summer.\u201d MN feels like a marketing scheme where staff don\u2019t care much about the quality of their product. Reminds me of when my parents got sucked into selling Amway back in the eighties.  But here\u2019s the thing: it\u2019s actually a good product.  Like that Amway laundry detergent. If they would do better at communicating with hosts and improve coding to fix the incessant glitches, which would require redirecting their energy away from the MLM vibes, it could be great."

Si esto no era suficiente el hotel del mismo resort del que nos separaba una l\u00ednea de plantas tambi\u00e9n estaba en obras con el consecuente trasiego de camiones, carretillas, graveras y el personal que una obra de estas dimensiones necesita.\nReuni\u00f3n de con la agencia presentaci\u00f3n con la agencia y llamada al n\u00famero del servicio de atenci\u00f3n al cliente que nos hab\u00edan facilitado.

Hemos sido pacientes y les hemos dado la oportunidad de encontrar una soluci\u00f3n adecuada al da\u00f1o producido pero se han re\u00eddo de nosotros con la propuesta que nos han hecho. En su p\u00e1gina siguen ofertando el mismo hotel sin advertir nada y las piscinas como maravilloso reclamo. Evidentemente vamos a denunciar para reclamar legalmente lo que consideramos ha sido \u00bfuna estafa?, los da\u00f1os y perjuicios ocasionados.\nPor supuesto tenemos todos los documentos de las reclamaciones, WhatsApp, videos y fotograf\u00edas que demuestran todas las afirmaciones aqu\u00ed declaradas que le fueron entregadas a la agencia de El Corte ingl\u00e9s en el momento de presentar la reclamaci\u00f3n."

However, never have I used such an established application in the world of social media have so many bugs. Unfortunately these bugs often make me close the app and not open it again for a few days, these bugs are so frustrating. Besides some obvious UX issues that make ease of use difficult and annoying, deleting a pin from one of your boards is one of the hardest things to do without encountering a bug, almost every time without fail, attempting to delete a pin results in the app seizing to respond and requiring a restart. Another common bug is on the front page, it\u2019s a similar issue to deleting a pin. Scrolling works just fine but interacting with the posts such as clicking on them is undoable. This really is a shame as the concept of Pinterest is great and I really enjoy using it. Hope to see some fixes soon."

Upon arriving at site each step we took was met with excellent guidance and utmost concern for our safety.  The waterfalls were breathtaking and most enjoyable along with our \u201cspa\u201d mud bath.  So rejuvenating \ud83d\ude0a !! Guides offered to take pictures of us enjoying ourselves and relaxing without us ever having to ask (DID I MENTION SO MEMORABLE).  Our lunch was delicious and oh so surreal \u2026 to indulge in a Costa Rican lunch along side the majestic waterfall took one day to make as a memory but it will last a lifetime.  The drive back, the conversation, and experience is something my husband and I HIGHLY recommend.  Paddle 9 and our gracious guides made the day simply terrific \u2026. PURA VIDA \u271d\ufe0f"

They have good sound, nice features, but unfortunately didn't fit in my ears well, and actually caused pain in my right ear from the earbud itself.  For less than half the price, I ended up buying these Tozo T6 earbuds.  Paired easily.  I also prefer memory foam tips, which I installed on these headphones (very helpful with blocking the wind when riding my motorcycle).  Fit well in my ear, and the sound is definitely competitive to my Samsung headphones.  Another issue I had with previous headphones is they wouldn't fit in the charging case with the memory foam tips.  This case doesn't have that problem.  Overall, very satisfied with these headphones.  Can't speak to the battery life, but if they last as long as was stated in the description, I will buy these headphones every time I need a new pair."

I decided to give it a try but then I returned to Bulgaria and found out that this plan is not available here. So, I decided to revert to my old plan, and to my surprise, oh wonder, that plan was no longer available, and if I wanted to continue watching, I now had to pay \u00a311 instead of the \u00a38 I used to pay! I contacted them through their chat, and their assistant told me that it was no longer possible to continue with the basic plan and if I hadn't changed my plan, there would have been no change! This feels a bit like a scam to me, making you switch to their new plan and then, if you don't like it due to their ads or in my case, if you travel to a country where it's not available, you end up having to pay them more. What's sad is that I was enjoying their programming, but after this misleading tactic from their side, and I would say a cunning way to make their customers pay more, it might be better to switch to HBO."

Some of my favorite memories have come as a result of staying somewhere I booked on this app. The best new feature is the city and hostel chats. Great for backpackers looking to meet up and make friends. However, not every property listed is truly a hostel, and be sure to check that the dorm or price listed available is applicable to you (female only dorms). At the risk of private equity completely commercializing hostel adventures for profit, sometimes you can save a few bucks and book directly with a hostel website and rather than this app taking 10% or so. I hope this app can continue to leverage technology and it\u2019s network size while still creating authentic travel experiences."

Maybe those hostels don\u2019t have chat functions enabled, but my main issue is the Message button not working. Again, that could just be my phone, but everything else in the app has worked for me. Otherwise, it\u2019s a good app."

    "content": "Impressive service (do not skip review)\n(PLEASE READ THIS REVIEW IF YOUR HESITANT ABOUT BUYING FROM TOZO)\nI brought these headphones back in August along with another pair of t1 both from tozo. The delivery was prompt and I have happily used both interchangeably while the other pair was charging. The sound quality on both are great although I personally think the t6 sound is better the t1 are smaller and fit comfortably for me.\nI was saddened the other day to find upon trying the t6 pair the right one had stopped functioning. At first I thought it was user error. Maybe I had not charged the case and it had died. I have a habit of only using one headphone while making calls (bonus feature for me). I charged the case throughly and the headphone.\nWhen I turned them on I found it still to not work. I thought maybe they had disconnected from each other, it has happened before. I proceeded to forget the device and repair the headphones. Both was flashing and paired. I could not understand what was going on. Until I tilted my head towards my phone and the sound started. When I moved my head again it stopped I realised then there is a loose connection within the headphone.\nI have no idea how this happened I use them within my own home never outside and never dropped. I went to amazon to message the seller as this is a fault. To find it\u2019s outside of the 30 day period. I did however find a link to their website and contacted them via that.\nI explained the situation. The advisor asked me to try to reinstall the headphones as this can happen, I tried again to no avail. I told them the fault and produced the receipt of purchase from amazon. To which they offered a brand new pair of headphones without charge, and without needing the old pair back. I was ecstatic. I love my t6 headphones, I was cheeky and asked for a different colour (I did not want the new ones getting mixed up with the defective pair) and they happily obliged without hesitation. They even offered me to choose the colour I wanted, I was quite happy with any colour as long as they are different.\nBrilliant service 10/10. I highly recommend. It\u2019s given me peace of mind knowing that when the time comes for me to finally upgrade my headphones again that I can rely on buying from tozo."

    "content": "Sad!\nIt is unfortunate that when companies consider partnership that they do not consider the impact on the customers. T-Mobile offered a package bundle in partnership with Netflix. The first month we signed up we had to call to get the charge on our debit/credit card reversed because we were already paying for it on our T-Mobile bill. Today, 2.25.24 we found out that Netflix charged us again. So we spent approximately 1 hour on the phone with Netflix and had to include T-Mobile on the call to help Netflix to create a seamless experience in assuring that we wouldn\u2019t be charged again this month. T-Mobile was able to see the Netflix deal added on their end but Netflix couldn\u2019t see the add on. Upon Netflix\u2019s request we had to log in and out of both accounts about 3 times with no different results. This was a fiasco. Nor did he provide a warm hand off we had to tell the manager everything all over again. Poor customer services.\n\nWe asked for a manager because we were truly disappointed with the services. We let T-Mobile go since they had did their part and had confirmed everything. We spent an additional hour on the phone with the manager, who asked for similar log in and out of both accounts but she continually asked about the email accounts connected as if T-Mobile couldn\u2019t have a different email than Netflix. Bizarre. \n\nWe left with the manager saying that she still did not see Netflix added with the T-Mobile package. So we had to try to rectify this matter ourselves because it appeared that Netflix was unable to resolved it. We asked that our debit/credit card be removed from the Netflix account and we will wait until next month to see if we get better results\u2026.we thought maybe it will take a while for the Netflix system to catch up with T-Mobile. \n\nMore training is needed when hiring others to be a better listener and to be provided the tools necessary to handle matters more than one way. Just like in the Court of Law there are always creative ways to get things done."

The functionality is clean and easy to use and it\u2019s always useful to look up other people\u2019s reviews and keep a watchlist of films I want to see. I was amazed to see the negative rating, but when I read the 1 star reviews they are all due to a scam email that pretends to be from Letterbox\u2019d. It\u2019s not them sending the emails and their reputation is unfairly getting trashed due to a scammer stealing their brand to try and scam people. It\u2019s completely understandable that people who receive this email are scared and want to warn others, but I feel sorry for this small Kiwi company getting caught up in this. If you receive this scam email don\u2019t click any links and delete the email. Please don\u2019t leave a 1 star review here as you\u2019re taking out your understandable fear and frustration on an undeserving target. Also, if you love movies I recommend downloading the app from the Apple / Android App Store."

    "content": "First time mac user\nThis laptop has unparalleled battery life, the screen is second only to Oled the notch is annoying and unnecessary but you get over it, they should really update the software so that the icons can't overflow under the notch. The keyboard is nice but it has very little travel, the trackpad is nice as well. Macos has its flaws but almost all of them can be fixed with third party tools, ie window snapping, keyboard history, gestures, ect... Keyboard shortcuts are a must for properly navigating the os. The one major thing lacking from this mac is the ability to play most games, but there is an active effort to solve that problem, and if you're really into gaming this laptop isn't for you. Also, this is touted as being great for video editing and photo editing, it is great for photo editng, plenty powerful and color accurate, however, video editing comes with a catch, it does everything well as long as is doesn't require 3d from a gpu such as noise reduction, in that case a proper dedicated gpu puts it to shame, a clip that takes 20 mins on a desktop 4090 will take 3-5 hours on this mac. Overall, as long as you have a desktop pc to fill the gaps of heavy duty video editing and gaming, this laptop is the perfect laptop for you honestly, even as someone who hated macos before I bought this. If this is going to be your only computer, just know that you will be severely lacking in said areas."

The gardens are meticulously maintained and offer carefully arranged vistas which include sculptures, Thai bonsai, and temple artifacts. Everything inspired tranquility and meditation.The pool isn\u2019t available to children under 12 so a temple-like atmosphere is maintained. Everything we saw at the hotel, we saw at various Lanna temples. Most welcome is its elegant and well-appointed library. We loved the restaurant and the pottery, ceramics and art throughout it and the hotel. The service was outstanding; help was available 24 hours a day. It was restorative to stay at Rachamankha. I would go back in a heartbeat. We felt truly lucky to stay there."

Our waitress, Shoshana was fantastic, happy, funny and very good at \u201csuggesting\u201d another round. \n\nThe views and beach are serene, beautiful, relaxing and inviting. Depending on the light, the water was 5 colors of blue. \n\nThe food was excellent - ceviche, beignets, poke, chicken sate, hummus - you can\u2019t go wrong. \n\nIf you are mobily challenged you should be aware that there are 90 steps down to the beach from the entrance."

Looking at the price they are an incredible value! They sound great, they fit me really well, they're small, the case holds loads of charge, the touch controls work great, even 4 years on they have no issues (except they're now flat haha). Fantastic earphones and for this price I don't think you can go wrong. Also before I got these I tried about 5 other well reviewed budget earphones and I returned them all, these were the best by far. Actually an amazing deal."

There\u2019s a gym and a sauna too.  It\u2019s clean and tidy and the staff are all lovely.  Rooms are bungalows with their own patio, scattered throughout the grounds - very spacious accommodation.

    "content": "14 Inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro Review\nUnboxing & Design: Standard unboxing, nothing extraordinary. The laptop feels solid, thanks to the unibody aluminum build. Love that ports are back!, but I'm really not a fan of the webcam notch \u2013 a larger top bezel or a different design would be better. The space black finish is nice, it appears more like a gunmetal grey in bright light, but in low light or oblique angles it is very black.\nPerformance: Scores well on geekbench, and cinebench. I haven't had any issues with performance, and vs my old base M1 macbook pro 8gb, its much much harder to summon the beach ball! Apple's gaming claims are a bit overhyped, or premature tho... there's hardly any, and running games through Crossover is okay.  Compatibility and performance are ymmv for sure. Get a gaming laptop if you want to game.\nDisplay: The Full array micro led backlight really helps HDR pop on this, and colors are fantastic. But in dark images with small bright highlights you can see some backlight blooming. 120hz refresh is always welcome, but know that macbook displays usually have pretty bad pixel response times so fast moving content tends to blur. Apple should move to OLED displays, this would fix their pixel response and backlight blooming.\nMemory & Storage: 18GB RAM does the job well, even for AI model stuff (stable diffusion, up to 13b llama models). The 1TB SSD is adequate, though I would've liked more without the Apple tax... Performance-wise, it's comparable to high-end PCIE4 M.2 NVMe drives.\nBattery & Charging: Battery life is good, lasts all day for light tasks, but anything that uses rosetta translation or gpu drains it much faster. Magsafe is great to have back, but the magnet feels too strong - worried it might damage the port or finish over time.\nValue: At $2400, it feels a bit overpriced. It's a solid buy for those upgrading from older Macs or Apple enthusiasts. If you're thinking of gaming on this, look elsewhere despite apple's recent boasting. Also, I miss Bootcamp - would been great to have the ARM version of Windows on this."

    "content": "Jack Sparrow\nPrivate tours arranged by Jack Sparrow in St. Lucia, West Indies. We stayed at Coconut Bay Beach Resort and Spa. The resort offers tours but they\u2019re group tours and prices can be much higher. \nJack Sparrow is not affiliated with the resort. He\u2019s a licensed tour guide. His office is located on the beach next to the resort. There were 4 in our group. You pick the activities that you want to check out and a driver will pick you up at the resort. Both days we toured, beverages and lunch was provided. Our drivers, Lyndon on our first tour and Calvin the second time were very professional and knowledgeable. They encouraged us to ask questions. The tours began in a small town on the Caribbean side of the island about a 45 minute drive from the resort on the Atlantic side. We boarded a boat to see the bat cave and the Pitons, two huge mountains off the coast, aka \u201cthe boobs\u201d of the island. We went to Sugar Beach. Snorkeling was awesome! Hundreds of types of beautifully colored fish of all kinds. A local serves up the best pi\u00f1a coladas from his small boat at the beach. We also enjoyed the 100 degree mineral bath, then mud bath, let it dry on your skin, our Guide then painted our faces and arms and backs with a black mud. He took pictures for us too. Back in the mineral bath to wash it off. They had showers to rinse off afterwards. Our skin felt amazing after that, soft as a baby\u2019s butt. \nThe last tour included watching the sun set at Black Sand Beach. I was curious about suba divers 10-20 ft out from the shore. The guide told me just like the Pitons that rise straight up from the sea the drop off is just as abrupt and drops a couple thousand feet. Wow! \nPricey? Not at all! For us 4 only $500! Including transportation by car and boat, including lunch, and a wonderful rum punch and soft drinks. The group tour arranged by Coconut Bay ran about $800 for 4. \nJack Sparrow is your man for setting up your amazing tour. You can find him right behind the Jerk Shack, on the beach."

Customers of the hotel can safely canoe for free in its exclusive lake. The food provided at the hotel is exceptional. The buffet breakfast includes genuine Vietnamese dishes and a chef who is ready to cook a fresh omelet upon your request. The hotel has the exclusive right to take its customers on a complimentary tour of a volcanic natural cave. My friends and I were fortunate enough to be taken to the first chamber of the cave by the kind manager, followed by a professional tour guid taking us to an adventure inside the cave. \nThe hotel manager is professional, friendly and passionate about serving customers. Even the Vietnam Tourism Minister chose to stay at this hotel while we were there, which highlights the hotel's exclusivity at a very reasonable price, perhaps half the cost of an average hotel in Hanoi.\nRegarding my personal experience, I had to stay at this hotel due to my individual circumstances. However, the understanding and care shown by the hotel manager and the assistant manager made me feel like a family member, and I will always be grateful to them. \nI am confident that you will enjoy your stay in this hotel and have a wonderful time in Mai Chau."

This feature was particularly convenient, as it allowed me to enjoy multimedia content without altering my phone\u2019s general settings. However, following recent updates, I\u2019ve noticed that this is no longer possible. Now, to hear audio in statuses, I have to take my phone off silent mode. This is quite inconvenient, as I prefer to keep my phone on silent most of the time.\n\nI am wondering why this change was implemented, as it seems to be a step back in terms of user convenience and functionality. Being able to consume media content with audio, while the phone is in silent mode, was a valued feature for me and likely for many other users who keep their phones muted as a standard practice.\n\nI hope this feedback is helpful and that consideration is given to reinstating the previous functionality. It would enhance the overall user experience and align with the seamless and user-friendly nature that WhatsApp is known for."

I have recently booked several places based on the good reviews shown on Hostelworld only to arrive at the accommodation and have an unpleasant experience. I never would have booked these accommodations If I had read the Google reviews before hand. My experiences perfectly align with the negative comments on Google. Now, I check the availability of each accommodation on this app and then read the Google reviews before booking. It is annoying having to go back and forth between the two sites,  so this app would be improved by including (or linking to) to Google profile of each accommodation."

I saw people right in front of me buying drugs all day long.  The vendors dug up the bags of cocaine and other drugs daily before the crowds came. \nThe beach was dangerous and the life guards didn\u2019t enforce at all. \nThe foam night parties were an orgy! I didn\u2019t feel comfortable at all as a mature women being there. The entertainment in the lobby was terrible.  \nThe food wasn\u2019t bad but certainly not excellent by any means.  The staff in the restaurants weren\u2019t pleasant at all.  \nThe drinks were watered down to the point of being laughable. \nI will never return or recommend this resort.  \nWhat a waste of money!!! \nI\u2019m sure it will continue to be popular but I hope you take these comments into your decision.  \nThere\u2019s more but\u2026."

Bluetooth earbuds have been coming in down in price over the years but not seemingly the quality.  I have bought these a few times - not because they have broken but because I have lost a couple of sets - perhaps that\u2019s the one disadvantage - they are cheap so you maybe don\u2019t take care of them like an expensive pair of air pods.\nBack to this. I make use of my headphones a lot.\nOn the commute to work and also when using the sauna which I regularly use.\nIn terms of sound these sound great - I genuinely wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference in quality between these and a far more expensive pair.  Music is clear, speaking (I listen to a lot of podcasts) is clear and they feel decent quality not some cheap plastic ones.\nThe buds come in their own case which charges them when they are in.  I bought these because they are waterproof and that\u2019s because I listen to these in the sauna and they work great in that environment whilst in the ear. I wouldn\u2019t recommend taking them out for example and leaving them in the sauna - that would damage them.\nLook out for the sales. They usually retail at around \u00a330 but are often on sale for \u00a321. At that price they are a bargain."

Now anytime I search for anything related to my interests or work, it just comes up with an endless stream of 10 second videos and not a single photo in sight. Even disabling autoplay does nothing to help this and there isn\u2019t a \u201cpictures only\u201d filter option. I am honestly so sad about this because I have used this platform basically since its inception many many years ago and has sadly opted for the same crappy approach to all platforms nowadays, all because of TikTok making video shorts the new default mechanic across all apps including this one. I was wrong to think Pinterest was better than the rest but I guess corporate greed and the brain rot of its users to increase engagement will always come first."

I opted for the Premium plan and ordered a chromatic card which was around $20 or so.\n\nThree weeks later, the card has not arrived. So I proceeded to try to reach customer service via chat which is a perk of the Premium plan. Low and behold, there is no customer service live chat feature in their help bar so you have to wait for a response email from an inexistent support team. Even after sending an email, common protocol is to receive a confirmation email. However, Revolut doesn\u2019t have that, meaning your message may or may not have reached them. No way of knowing. \n\nAlso, be aware that there is no phone number to call. For a bank in the United States to not have a customer service phone number is a huge red flag.\n\nIf you have funds left in the app, there is no way to withdraw them without having the card, which once again they didn\u2019t send. So, essentially you are stuck having money in a mysterious bank account without any customer support and you watch it get drained by the monthly premium fees. Another huge red flag.\n\nIf you terminate the premium plan early, they charge $19.98. So basically, you pay $20 for a card and $19.98 for early termination of premium plan, you cannot get your money back and you have no way to speak to somebody in order to get help. Imagine getting stuck in a foreign country being at the mercy of Revolut - it would be a total nightmare! This is a total SCAM so please do not fall for this. \n\nI am reporting this company to the FDIC. I hope this helps any of you readers to avoid getting scammed like I did."

Some common problems I have are:\n\n- refuses to show me my updates/notifications (like it\u2019ll give me the badge that I have 3 new, but when I tap onto the tab it either shows there\u2019s nothing there or just a completely blank page like it hasn\u2019t loaded at all)\n\n- just freezes completely, have to force stop the app to fix it\n\n- when you try to save a pin from the preview, the list of boards gets stuck on the loading screen indefinitely. Have to close and reopen the app and then actually go on to the pin itself or the glitch will just repeat. \n\n- crashing, less common but just as annoying\n\n- when mass moving pins from one board to a different board, it saves them into the general board instead of the section I chose. I then have to go in, reselect them all and move to the section again, which works. \n\nI think there\u2019s more things I\u2019m forgetting about but those are what come to mind. My phone is not outdated or broken and is fully updated and in working order, so it\u2019s not a problem on my end. I don\u2019t have any of these problems with the web version on my PC."

I dedicated substantial time and effort to photograph each item personally, meticulously ensuring that the photos were clear and professional by using a white background and even going the extra mile to watermark my images to prevent them from being copied.\n\nHowever, my enthusiasm quickly dwindled when, shockingly, Vinted deleted all my listings, unjustly claiming the photos weren't mine. This accusation couldn't be farther from the truth, as I personally took each photo. \n\nWhat makes this situation even more frustrating is the apparent lack of a reliable mechanism to verify the originality of images, leading to unjustified deletions of authentic listings. Such experiences not only waste the seller's time and effort but also significantly undermine trust in Vintive's systems and policies.\n\nAfter this ordeal, I made the decision to delete my account, concluding that Vinted is not the supportive and reliable platform I initially believed it to be. This incident has been incredibly disheartening, and I feel compelled to advise others to reconsider using  their services.\n\nPotential users, please proceed with caution."

    "content": "Excellent true wireless earbuds\nThe TOZO T6 true wireless earbuds are a great option for anyone looking for a budget-friendly pair of earbuds that offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit.The earbuds come with six different ear tip sizes, making it easy to find the right fit for your ears. The ear tips have slightly different feels to them, where the ones with red in the center feel a bit stiffer and thicker, and the all-black ones are thinner. The shape of some of the all-black ones makes them look wider than they would fit in your ear, so there are two ear tips measuring 10mm and two measuring 11mm, but each will fit differently inside your ear. The earbuds also don\u2019t have vents to alleviate pressure from the ear tips sealing, so you may have to adjust the earbuds a bit to get rid of the pressure1.\nThe earbuds come with a charging case that supports wireless charging, which is a great feature to have. The case is compact and fits easily into any moderately sized pocket. It has a secure enough lid that it doesn\u2019t open on its own at the bottom of a tote bag, and the earbuds stay secure with magnets inside too. On the bottom of the case is a plastic flap covering the charging port, which likely serves to keep water and dust from getting in. Both the case and the earbuds are water-resistant at IPX8 level.\nIn terms of sound quality, the TOZO T6 earbuds have a slightly bass-heavy sound profile, which should please fans of EDM and hip-hop. The earbuds are small and lightweight, and their decently comfortable fit should be suitable for extended listening sessions.\nOverall, the TOZO T6 true wireless earbuds are a great option for anyone looking for a budget-friendly pair of earbuds that offer decent sound quality and a comfortable fit. The wireless charging feature and water-resistant design are added bonuses that make these earbuds a great value for the price."

The lid doesn't flip all the way back, giving a very small space to get your fingers in, and the earbuds themselves and tapered to make getting a grip on them difficult. To top it all off the magnet holding them in place is stronger than it needs to be, meaning if your grip - again, difficult due to both tapering and a lack of apace - fails in the slightest, the thing is immediately sucked back in."

    "content": "BLOWN SPEAKERS but otherwise great\nSOUND UP! I was writing a glowing review last night at how amazing is my new MacBook Pro M3 Pro (18gb/512gb/11 cores) and thought I'd better add a comment on the sound quality. Well, I checked the sound on Apple Music, and my speakers are blown on arrival :(\nJust received the laptop yesterday, and it arrived in an ice cold state via UPS (I am in a moderate climate but we had a cold front this week with freeze warnings). I am guessing delivery loaded it the night before and left it out in the freezing 29 degree temps overnight. But I let it warm to room temp and put it on the charger for awhile before firing it up. The battery history showed it had dipped from the 100% charged at the factory down to 57% for the less than one day that it travelled in shipping. I was not overly alarmed by this until I checked the sound. At modest sound levels the entire midrange is blown out, which range I was able to narrow down with the Music app's equalizer. Probably it was the cold exposure but it could have been otherwise mishandled.\nTo verify that it was not operator error despite my ownership of a crazy number of Macs going back to 1989, I googled this speaker crackling and distortion issue on MacBook Pros. Well, apparently this is a frequent issue and I learned three things:\n1. Well, number 1 I already knew, you really have to break in any speaker at midlevel volume for a day or two before blasting to warm up the speaker and avoid damage, it still should not be a distorted crackling mess though at medium volume, but I did let it play music for several hours to warm up the speakers hoping for improvement.\n2. MacBook speakers are very fragile, so even if you have great sound, you could lose it in the future if you are not very careful in handling the laptop to avoid bumping the laptop around, even in a case. The speakers tear easily and there are YouTube videos on how to glue them back together if your Mac is no longer under warranty.\nAnd 3. The MacBook Pro M3 Pro with 11 cores has actually LESS PERFORMANCE CORES than the M2 and M1 versions that only have 10 total cores. Because Apple increased the EFFICIENCY CORES not the performance cores in these lower end M3 Pro models. So an M1 Pro with 10 cores has 8 performance cores and two efficiency, the M2 Pro with 10 cores has 6 performance cores with 4 efficiency, and the M3 Pro 11 core has ONLY 5 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores. Also the M3's music volume is measurably lower than in the M2 according to YouTubers. Generally this is fine, but it is NOT FINE FOR MUSIC MAKING when combining tracks, even when using Apple's DAW for mixing tracks because most utilize performance cores not efficiency cores. I am not making complex music though, just listening to Adell on Apple Music, and it sounds terrible. So I will attempt to swap out this Mac but if it is similarly tossed around at delivery or in the Amazon Warehouse, or left out in the cold overnight, this could happen again. BUMMER and a waste!\nAside from the painful sounds, there were two operating issues also: I can't \"SHARE\" to email or messages in Safari, those options are blanked out in System Settings, which is a glitch I hope. And Apple's \"Stocks\" app crashed running in the background, even though no third party apps were also running, or even loaded up yet. Still this is an amazing laptop that is a vast improvement in power and speed over both of my M1's - iMac (16gb) and iPad Air 5th gen. But I recommend skipping any \"Pro\" version that is less than 18gb RAM or 512gb SSD. Why bother? Just get a MacBook Air M2! The Space Black color of the M3 Pro is a welcome change from the silver versions I've been staring at for 2 decades, but I wish Midnight (dark blue) was an option on these.\nI also recommend the Apple HomePod Minis, which are not bluetooth so you can't easily use them with just anything, but they connect via Airplay to Macs and also to Amazon Music's App, which is not available on the laptop OS but is an iOS app. I haven't tested whether you can run airplay through Amazon Music on a web browser. Just one of these tiny speakers sounds far and away better than the laptop speakers combined, and also better than Alexa device offerings for home speakers. Another thing I recommend is to use the Apple Music app's equalizer settings and adjust them for each song. Most songs sound great in \"Lounge\" or \"R&B\" as a starting point, and the music will be both louder and cleaner on your MacBook. The app's separate settings menu also allows you to add sound enhancement generally that greatly improves quality and volume."

When I use my personal phone and iPad they can sign in okay, but when I try to cast to the Smart TV it displays the same error. I am not going to pay for multiple accounts just so I can watch my own Netflix when I travel around the UK. Netflix need to sort out this bug IMMEDIATELY and stop providing useless \u201csupport\u201d that doesn\u2019t actually fix the error. Not to mention the fact that my Netflix subscription has doubled since I first bought it in 2017; this is appalling service for a long time customer and not what I am paying my hard earned money for!"

They have focused far too much on social \u2018chat\u2019 features which were already present in the old app. Why they have removed the wish list is beyond me. It is not even possible to save, star or favourite an accommodation any more, you have to search it again every time to find it. An appalling update and an appalling decision from Hostelworld developers. A favourite feature is the most basic and crucial part of an app, and it is gone? I hope this finds the developers as soon as possible, it needs to be changed and updated right now."

I have found lots of cooking recipes, hacks, and just plain videos that make me laugh! With all that said, after using it for almost a year now I do have one note. The app seems to constantly glitch for me. Sometimes, only on this app, the screen just freezes. I try clicking the back arrow or fiddling around with the buttons but it won\u2019t work. Which means I have to go out of the app, and close the screen. After a couple minutes I go back into the app and it\u2019s completely normal. This frustrates me because if I search up clips and am scrolling through them and found a sequence I like I lose it. (Because it sends you videos that it thinks you\u2019ll like everytime) Besides this one glitch I really enjoy this app, I find myself trying new things and actually being productive with it. It has inspired me to do so many things! Thanks for reading!"

There are other blends made by this company that I prefer - but this English breakfast tea simply is not as good in Quality as it once was.  Let's hope Taylor's corrects this problem before I consider another brand."

Everything is easily accessible and nicely organized. My MacBook Air literally lives in this bag and has never been scratched or damaged. Comfortable straps with no signs of tearing or separating at the shoulder. My last backpack had the strap start to fall off in a year which is why I bought this one. At this rate it will last me 5+ years I'm sure. I've gone on at least a dozen flights with it and it is a great carryon/personal item.\nI have seen other people with this same backpack at airports and it definitely seems to be a popular choice.

Me atendi\u00f3 Mar y no me ofreci\u00f3 consejo sobre hoteles para mis necesidades, solo estaba interesada en que hiciera reserva, no me aseguraba que me dieran la habitaci\u00f3n cu\u00e1druple, me dio la sensaci\u00f3n de que parec\u00eda que no se compromet\u00eda en ning\u00fan momento con lo contratado.

Nos tuvimos que buscar la vida porque llam\u00e9 desde all\u00ed y Mar en ning\u00fan momento nos ayud\u00f3. Tampoco se puso en contacto la empresa ni con nosotros ni con el hotel para comunicarnos el punto de recogida al aeropuerto. Tras poder contactar y ayudarnos la recepcionista del hotel pudimos llegar a un punto donde nos recogieron y el trayecto lo hicimos con el conductor fumando. La empresa en Roma de Euro Travel 2004 p\u00e9sima, no acept\u00e9is que os la contrate el Corte Ingl\u00e9s, que luego se desentiende de todo y te dejan tirado. Una pena que un viaje empiece y acabe de forma tan lamentable. P\u00e9sima gesti\u00f3n de Mar, no puedo decir otra cosa."

I discovered how to be my own person because I learned how to best live and find my path through so many ways, new and exciting. I studied many wonderful subjects about history, living with pure honesty, kindness, thoughtfulness, peace, and success in finding total happiness.  Exhilaration in my happiness.  \nAt the same time and in th he same book, I found Miss Annabelle, who became my best friend as she taught 12 students, not only what third graders should learn but a new way to think for themselves,build the life they wanted and how to  create success and share it with our world.  \nI love my life, the people I\u2019ve grown to love and appreciate while we all stand together to build our place in the Civilization of the Universe and find peace with the Prime  Law.

I wore these to my dance recital and my dance classes they fit true to size bc they supposed to be a little bit snug so just a heads up. I ordered a size 9- what I usually order and they are amazing if you are thinking about buying. Please and thank you"

    "content": "Pinterest is amazing, the mobile app not so much\nPinterest was wonderful and I\u2019ve used it religiously for the past 10 years and probably have millions of pins saved. Now three things have become recently bad enough for me to come to the review section and write one but only for the phone app. The Pinterest website at least on a laptop is still as wonderful as it always was.\n1) Ads\n2) Crashing the app\n3) Constant changes to how to work with the pins\n\n1. I\u2019d attach a screenshot if I could, but sometimes, there\u2019s more ads on the screen then there are pins. If you fit 6 pins on the screen, 3 of them are often ads. There\u2019s always a minimum of one no matter where you are and if you accidentally press one it straight away opens a new link.\n2. If you scrolling through saved pins, and you\u2019re going through each one individually, there\u2019s the little icon on the bottom right corner that sometimes blocks the words written on the pin. So if you touch the pin and move it down a little you can read the entire text. Now the problem is if you do that, sometimes it crashes the app so bad it exits you out, or it blanks the screen so you have to go back to the homepage and then back to your saved pins and it starts you back at the top of the board. It\u2019s been a problem when I had the iPhone 11 pro but now I have a 15 and exact same problem. \n3. The way that Pinterest work changes once every couple months for about a week to a month, then they revert back to how it was. About two weeks ago, they did it so you had to swipe right out of a pin instead of swiping down, but now they\u2019ve changed it back. That\u2019s just the most recent, but stuff like this happens all the time and you always have to change how you\u2019re doing it and relearn something that\u2019s been the same for years and worked perfectly well.\n\nOther than that Pinterest is amazing it\u2019s just their mobile app mess ups that make it less enjoyable to use."

    "content": "Best of Many Brands\nCompared to:\nGoli (KSM66) - almost as effective as YouTheory but has added sugars.  Had to take 6 or more gummies to feel the same effects as YouTheory.\nLilCare (Root extract) - less effective but does work.  Added sugars and black pepper (among several other added ingredients).\nTribe Organics (KSM66) - sugar free and almost as effective as YouTheory.\nDailyNutra (KSM66) - less effective and contains black pepper.\nVitaFusion (Sensoril) - added sugars and other ingredients.  Could not feel any effects.\nEmergenC - (KSM66) added sugars and other ingredients.  Could not feel effects.\n(Should be noted that black pepper aids in absorption by irritating gut lining.)\nWhere YouTheory really shines is in the effects of calming and being less reactive to typical triggers.  Ashwagandha isn\u2019t a sedative so first time users should not expect to feel any different\u2026 but your negative/impulsive reactions should become more manageable and triggers should be easier to avoid.\nI believe the mix of KSM and root extract gives YouTheory the upper hand when compared to all others I\u2019ve tried.  To put things into perspective, I would rate YouTheory as an 8 or 9 and Goli a 6 or 7.  Tribe Organics would also be a close second but none of the others are worth purchasing based solely on effects.\nI continue to try other supplements but haven\u2019t found any other products that compare.  Have tried root extract, Sensoril, and KSM66.  To this point, YouTheory\u2019s mix of KSM and root has been the best.  I\u2019ll be trying Shoden very soon and will update this review, if it\u2019s comparable to YouTheory.\n(Never paid or given products for reviews; just trying to help others save money and improve their health.)\nUPDATE: June 13, 2023\nThis is still my favorite and can be found in 150 count (cheaper) here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07Y9QW3D1?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title"

I know they raised these access concerns with you some time ago, but there\u2019s been no improvement in the app\u2019s accessibility. \nThe text is tiny and the colour contrast between text and background is poor. There are no accessibility options within the app to change font size and, although I have Large Text enabled on my iPhone, this app does t have dynamic text, so the font remains stubbornly small. \nIt is so important that app and website designers learn about how they can make their work accessible to everyone and embed accessibility in at the design stage. Nearly 1 in 4 people in the UK are disabled, so that\u2019s a lot of people to ignore!"

I think this is an amazing app and I truly love it. It is such a calm app and there\u2019s no hate. I love how you can post things and just inspire others and others can do the same for you.

This one holds decent portions and fits well in her lunch box with a full-size ice pack. It is simple for her to open and close, and she enjoyed the utensils that came with it. My only complaint is that the top lid that closes over the utensils broke on her the first week of school, basically rendering the utensils useless now as they will just fall out. Doesn\u2019t affect the overall functionality of the box and we still use it, but slightly disappointed."

Previously, while exploring the map, stumbling upon towns, islands, or areas with undiscovered hostels led to exciting new opportunities for me. The current search area functionality feels limiting, causing me to overlook potential places to explore and stay. Restoring the ability to roam and search specific locations would enhance my travel experience and increase bookings for hostel owners. Considering this, I now prefer using Booking.com for its more flexible search options. Reintroducing this user-friendly feature would not only benefit my travel experiences but also contribute to the growth and revenue of Hostelworld."

Altro problema: Da un po\u2019 di tempo non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 possibile utilizzare chromecast integrato alla tv e trasmettere Netflix dallo smartphone, almeno per la mia esperienza, a meno che non abbiate un dispositivo chromecast esterno alla tv. Netflix con la scusa di recuperare clienti mi sa che ne perder\u00e0 molti. Non ultimo sembra che stia passando molti clienti ad account premium e non si capisce con quale modalit\u00e0. Attenzione Netflix, come dice il proverbio: \u201cchi troppo vuole nulla stringe\u201d."

    "content": "2nd Purchase in 3 years\nWe bought this three years ago for our ELDEST. A boy rough and tumble teenager carried it through Middle School with 20 pounds of weight and a stainless steel water bottle it survived three years of being tossed around. He refuses to have any other book bag I bought him a namebrand and he will not use it because of how many pockets and the secret pocket That\u2019s in the back to protect his phone. So we recently upgraded by buying the same exact thing but it seems to be better than the one that we had he said the zippers are different longer whatever that maybe he is on the spectrum so he notices small differences. And he was willing to change colors instead of gray we got black.  When the bag came in I was sick and he made his book bag switch over which is a really big deal that\u2019s how much he wanted to use it the only problem we had with his old book back is he got the mesh part caught on something and ripped it where his stainless steel water bottle went and that hole grew bigger. It never completely bottomed out but I didn\u2019t want my son walking around with a beat up book bag that was three years old as a freshman in high school after purchasing a namebrand he doesn\u2019t care about brands I just wanted him to fit in. I wasted my money on name that namebrand did not have all the features this one did especially that pocket which now I believe every book bag should have because my daughter does not have one and we\u2019ve had issues with phones being stolen at school. They cannot put it in the outer pockets somebody will steal it  or steal something out of their bag so important things need to be put in that hidden pocket that is up against the users back. It holds my son\u2018s laptop/Chromebook and every there are no lockers so everything he has for school is in that bag. Considering the last one was still usable it still is it\u2019s just I would prefer a nicer cleaner look the gray I could\u2019ve cleaned it yes but the black looks sleeker and they have seemed to have made improvement or the black it\u2019s just different than the gray I don\u2019t know. I am just this is a 10 out of a 10 recommendation. When you\u2019ve got very very picky children where you have to buy multiples of everything if they like something he wears the same pair of pants to school every day  they don\u2019t care that it\u2019s the same pair so you buy multiples. So I\u2019m going to probably buy more of these book bags to get him through high school college and he wants an emergency book bag. Bag. As a family emergency plan every human has a book bag/bag it\u2019s tactical to carry lifesaving emergency items.\nAnd we\u2019re ahead of the game because his old book bag is still usable besides one mesh pocket the newer version that I\u2019m reviewing right now I will say the pocket seems to be deeper than mesh pocket that is on the side that his water bottle goes in it seems to be larger than the last one it\u2019s the same water bottle that he\u2019s had For two school years in a row and it fits much tighter snugger and deeper.\nI used to feel like his water bottle was going to fall out it never did but the way it looked it made me feel that way as a neurodivergent person I hope other neurodivergent person can appreciate this review and the type of detailing I\u2019m giving. And I am happy to come back with a video comparing the two. We did go with the larger size I wasn\u2019t sure what I ordered a couple years ago size wise. I went to my orders I clicked on the book bag and there is options and I\u2019m like what size did I order took the measuring tape and it said it was at least 17 inches so I knew he needed the 17 inch one. at pictures when trying to purchase is confusing when you click sizes if you click on the 15 inch some of the pictures are still the same as the 17 inch. So that is difficult to understand we do have the 17 inch I recommend that over the 15 inch. Yes it does cost more money but you get so much more with the few extra dollars.  The shoulder straps are comfortable. They have never broken. At one point when we first got his original bag the doctor had to write a note due to his traumatic brain injury he has some health or physical conditions with his lungs and his book bag could not weigh more than 17 pounds. He was starting to have a hunch back bad posture and pain . Because there are no more lockers that\u2019s not a thing where we live. But since then he\u2019s grown seven in the year of 2023. I still feel like he shouldn\u2019t be caring 20 pounds but it is helping build strength and his posture is much better with this book bag keeping his shoulders back . I do these reviews because that\u2019s how I purchase items how I make decisions are based on reviews. My son is almost the same height as me I\u2019m 5 foot 11. He is high-level now so I would say he\u2019s 59 to 510 he\u2019s about 100 pounds  This book bag suits him wonderfully it is a book bag that I will be purchasing for myself. I don\u2019t know the specs in terms of waterproof or anything like that. He does like the ability to put a charger in it a power bank. Each pocket has a specific purpose. And it didn\u2019t change too much  The outside pockets that are exposed are still well placed and in a way hidden. Still not a place to put a phone. Phones his does not go in his pocket most children I know use them in their pockets. Their school allows them to have phones. My son feels that he could be pickpocketed . So that zipper is a game changer. I have seen dupes of this book bag and they do not have that zipper it looks like it in the picture but it\u2019s a mesh airflow there is no zipper there do not fall for the dupes I almost dead I almost purchased the wrong bag  that\u2019s why I always go back to my original order to re-order from. I favorite things. Unfortunately sometimes those things are no longer there we got lucky with this book bag. Now we have a namebrand from when I was in school that sort of useless it does not have the features nowhere near the features this book has for computer/tablet or laptop. Don\u2019t waste your money on Jan sports. But again my kid does not care about brands I order the same shoe and the next size and have been for years I ordered the same pants and a different size and he wears them every single day he has the same pair of pants. with a genius IQ 4.925 GPA going for engineering a believes this is the best book bag well-made book bag there is. I am not as smart as my child just super neurodivergent spicy uses talk to text this review is for other neurodivergent people. I know I make very long posts or reviews. Too much to read. Details matter. For the people that will not read it this review is not for them for the people that need to know little details this is for you. And I will be back with pictures and videos highlighting the features that we like the most. I mean the user of the book bag. I will be the one highlighting them as he does not consent to being on camera. I will do my best to reinterpret his explanations of the features. Everything above was my experience as a parent a neurodivergent parent purchasing for a neurodivergent  child !"

Je vais commencer par les points positifs, le personnel est tr\u00e8s gentil et souriant, l h\u00f4tel ou nous \u00e9tions c\u00f4t\u00e9 famille esmeralda est vraiment tr\u00e8s belle, le hall est a aire ouverte tr\u00e8s moderne et d\u00e9cor\u00e9e avec go\u00fbt!  Les drinks au bar du lobby sont parfaits et tres bons , Les chambres modernes ont une bonne grandeur avec grand balcon. Il y a 3 piscines, une grande centrale tr\u00e8s bruyante, une petite piscine c\u00f4t\u00e9 enfant et une autre un peu plus tranquille, mais quand il y a de l animation tu l entends assez fort partout sur le site de l h\u00f4tel, difficile pour ceux qui veulent se reposer et essayer de dormir . La plage sur une semaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 belle 3 fois, c est a dire sans gros vents ni vagues et presque pas d algues, par contre les 4 autres journ\u00e9es c \u00e9tait vraiment tr\u00e8s tr\u00e8s venteux et des tr\u00e8s grosses vagues , drapeau rouge et noir , beaucoup d algues.   Pour le  C\u00f4t\u00e9 n\u00e9gatif , la bouffe \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s ordinaire, on a beau dire que c est Cuba mais ici on ne parle pas d un 2-3 \u00e9toiles quand m\u00eame. Le buffet est tr\u00e8s petit et r\u00e9p\u00e9titif , toute la semaine exactement la m\u00eame bouffe assez basique. Pendant 4 jours il n y a pas eu de lait, oeufs,vin rouge et blanc, beurre, aucune p\u00e2te de toute la semaine, une seule journ\u00e9e ou nous avons eu des frites, aucune vinaigrette pour la salade sauf de l huile assez \u00e9paisse, les seuls fruits \u00e9taient des ananas, papayes et de temps en temps des fruits en cannes, apr\u00e8s 4 jours de ces aliments de bases manquants c a devient un peu irritant de prendre son caf\u00e9 noir et c\u00e9r\u00e9ales sans lait lolll , nourriture pas vraiment go\u00fbteuse, mettons que tu manges pour manger mais vraiment pas pour d\u00e9guster car tout est assez fade . Le service edt tr\u00e8s lent, tu attends toujours longtemps pour avoir une cuill\u00e8re, de l eau, du caf\u00e9 etc... Autre point tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gatif est qu il y a beaucoup de russes qui sont vraiment d\u00e9rangeant, coupe la file et passe devant tout le monde, un groupe de 5 personnes ont vid\u00e9 les humbergers qui \u00e9taient r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux personnes du resto assis a la table et qui attendaient leurs assiettes, apres 30 minutes d attentes nous nous sommes fait dire qu il n y en avait plus pour nous, pourtant nous avions command\u00e9 bien avant eux, idem quand tu vas au buffet ou au bar, ce sont les Roi et Ma\u00eetres et les serveurs ne disent rien, vraiment vraiment d\u00e9solant \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f donc pour tout ces inconv\u00e9nients assez d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ables , je ne retournerai plus a cette h\u00f4tel ."

Dogs on leads are also welcome. \n\nMartin lead us down the hill to the quarry  which are no longer being mined. Once underground we could see a huge network of man made caves.

The food was superb and the restaurant in general very impressive, the service was of an exceptional standard , nothing too much trouble . I started with the octupus which was the best I have tasted in the algarve , my wife started with the prawns in a sumptuous sauce which we were advised to add some bread to our order - great idea ! I ended up finishing off my wife\u2019s starter as it was so so good . Mains we both went for the seabass , fish was so white and tender , you could tell it was so fresh . Desert was the homemade apple pie and ice cream , so different to back in England but so tasty . The meal in general I could not fault and the price of the meal very reasonable for the experience we had . We will definitely be back next year ."

HostelWorld charges a \u201cdeposit\u201d that is a percentage of the total. I say \u201cdeposit\u201d because it goes directly to them and not to the hostel you\u2019re booking through. HostelWorld doesn\u2019t allow you to change your booking on their website, only cancel which can be inconvenient if you only want to update and not completely delete the reservation. If you want to update your reservation you have to go through the hostel directly. If you update through the hostel, that \u201cdeposit\u201d you paid is not put towards your new balance and it is non-refundable. So basically that money is gone and you don\u2019t get it back. Since the money was never sent to the hostel they have no way of helping you. Most hostels don\u2019t charge a deposit on your booking so I would ALWAYS go through them directly. Learn from my mistake!!"

The set up is quick and easy with the TOZO earphones and they fit almost flush to the ear so don't get caught and flick out of your ear.

Also you should add a camera simble next to all the chats so you can just click on that and send a specific photo to each chat, instead of changing it in settings every time\ud83d\ude2b another good reason is because Snapchat is 17+ or something so basically no one is allowed it, if you include these simple things then it might just be the next big app, isn\u2019t that what you want??? I know exactly what your thinking why would any idiot like me waste all of this time just for a comment? Well because it\u2019s not just me talking about this, it\u2019s the whole freakin school!!

That\u2019s unfair. And second, I\u2019d never been banned before on that account, you guys just took my account away from me without a warning.. also unfair. I want to be given a chance to fix my mistake and if i get my account back i promise ill go through every single board and delete the pins that i think go against community guidelines. Pinterest played a massive role in my everyday life, id go on it every single day and look and save pins. I had so many pins on there and now its all just gone. I\u2019m so upset because of this. I don\u2019t even want to go onto the app because every pin i saved is gone and i have to start from scratch.

The controls are pretty easy to use, only issue can be the volume control, if you knock the earbud sometimes it will either turn the volume to full or to mute. They are not really noise cancelling, but I didn't expect them to be (I have some much pricier ones which promise noise cancelling and fail to deliver) but they do block some outside noise which is fine for me. A big plus is that they are water resistant and can be used if working out or if it starts to rain. If you are looking for comfortable, well priced earbuds that provide decent sound, some noise cancellation and water resistance these are for you."

Then my fianc\u00e9 accidentally washed them! They still worked and I still used them until I could get another pair and I am still keeping those as back up just in case. So why do I say charge is the best? I could use them 2-3 weeks without charging. I use them at work for my breaks and sometimes longer then that or on the weekends when the kids would rather watch movies. Or when I\u2019m cleaning and cooking I\u2019ll put one in my ear. I like how at the bottom the lights go down one by one as it\u2019s loosing battery so you know that\u2019s it\u2019s getting low. Also when you pull the ear bud out it\u2019ll flash blue and it means it\u2019s pairing to your device. If you even just pull one ear bud out it\u2019ll connect with just one or you can wear both and they\u2019ll connect. I personally like that you can just use one if you want to since I am a busy worker and mom. I\u2019d definitely recommend or buy these as gifts \ud83d\ude00"

I recently purchased this item and loaded it up with the following: headphones, portable charger, umbrella, drink bottle, laptop + peripherals (mouse, attachable screen and game controller), Kindle, change of clothes, wallet, keys, phone, journal and pens. This backpack handled those items perfectly with the correct storage solutions for everything from side elastics for the drink and umbrella, pockets for the electronics, etc.\nI love the concept of \"backpack for security\" and the ability to attach the backpack to a suitcase, lock the two main compartments which coincidentally have my most expensive items inside and hide valuables inside the anti-pickpocket pocket against your back is genius and wins this backpack some awards in my book. The backpack is also wonderfully comfortable despite being loaded up with moderately heavy/bulky items and feels light on the back which isn't huge for someone like me who doesn't wear it for long periods of time but if you're going on a day-trip to the city or walking between classes at school? It's a lifesaver.\nThe backpack has a charging cable that can connect to your portable charger inside the backpack which is great for charging on the go and also comes with lifetime warranty if you register it which is a nice added bonus and speaks to their faith in the construction and durability of the product.\nOverall, for the price? This backpack is an absolute steal."

It's still new so I can't tell you how it's going to do after 2 months of being in the sun on rain. But I will update my review. So far. I can already tell it's way better than the other ones I've ordered and you can fit two bikes under it. E-bikes regular 10 speed of distance bikes. You can probably fit three.\nUPDATE still going strong! I'm going to purchase another one for my friend's bike as a gift."

The cable for the inbuilt USB port is so low-tier that when I connect my battery pack, which would otherwise charge my phone fine, my phone will lose charge faster than it will gain it if I\u2019m using it while charging. And I think the only reason to have a port on the outside is to be able to charge while using your phone because otherwise you could just put your phone in your bag.\nI still use the backpack daily, but don\u2019t get it for the USB port."

In some respects it is, it allows you to change currencies and withdraw from atms in foreign countries. Not bad if you plan to use it for a couple of holidays a year.\n\nUnfortunately, if you plan to travel long term, a lot of the advertised perks are completely pointless. Such as the cash back rewards. These are only eligible in the country where you first set up the card, and cannot be changed without cancelling the card and selling your portfolio of stocks/crypto/ commodities. \n\nAs for the travel insurance! This is a complete joke and I urge people not to rely on this as medical cover. It would be a great perk to have from Revolut, but the insurance is provided through a 3rd party - \u2018Allianz\u2019, who have so many clauses and loopholes written in to the cover, it is almost guaranteed you will not be able to make a claim when you need to!\n\nIf Revolut can improve this app so it is more applicable for the long term traveller it would be great. Likewise, they really need to be honest with their customers about what a joke the medical cover is. Fortunately I only missed out on a few hundred dollars, but it is not uncommon for medical expenses to really rack up and it is unlikely you would ever see a penny from this Allianz/ Revolut cover."

The site and the structures are simply amongst the most magnificent on earth. The pictures in books cannot replace the views from the heights of Athens ( no buildings are allowed anywhere near the height of the Acropolis) and cannot reveal the timelessness and sense of history thick in the air. The constant repair of damage done by the Persians and many others, including failed restoration projects by the Greeks since the 1800s, cannot remove the extraordinary vibe of this ancient seat of great glory and mysterious Gods and great leaders and rulers. The seamless tourist process was very good although we were not offered headphones and an auditory guide which would have been appreciated. The signposting leaves a little to be desired in terms of available options and must have been obstructed by the large crowds."

Aqu\u00ed no queda la cosa... En dicho hotel el hombre q nos preparaba las excursiones me dice q me quit\u00e9 el cord\u00f3n d oro con la chapa d la foto d mi madre por seguridad, despu\u00e9s d eso pasaron una serie d cosas q me llevan a pensar un poco mal,yo me lo quito y lo guardo en la habitaci\u00f3n y cual es mi sorpresa el d\u00eda q me voy?? Q el cord\u00f3n y la medalla no est\u00e1, se lo digo al hotel y nadie sabe nada.. No pudimos poner denuncia porque vinieron a recogernos q nos ivamos y cuando puedo me pingo con mi agencia (el corte ingl\u00e9s) me dice q cuando volvamos lo miramos todo bien a ver q podemos hacer y ahora una vez aqu\u00ed me dice q no pueden hacer nada, cuando llev\u00e1bamos un seguro pagado en el q entra robo, p\u00e9rdida o estravio y resulta q un cord\u00f3n d oro con una chapa q supera los 1000 euros lo consideran hurto y no me Dan esperanzas d q pueda hacer nada... Lo pelearse hasta el final no s\u00f3lo por el valor econ\u00f3mico q tiene q es bastante, sino por lo sentimental q llevaba la foto d mi madre q por desgracia no est\u00e1... No se para q te venden la moto de contratar seguros cuando viajas si luego no sirven para nada...

    "content": "PURA MISERIA DE VIAJES ECI\nEl pasado mes de agosto teniamos concertado un viaje a EEUU para 5 personas con vuelos, 2 d\u00edas de hotel en New York y un crucero por el caribe oriental con salida desde New Jersey. Entre los servicios contratados estabe el traslado desde el aeropuerto JFK hasta el hotel de New York. La entrada por la Aduana fue ca\u00f3tica y tardamos en cruzarla m\u00e1s de dos horas y media (al parecer cosa habitual que nosotros desconoc\u00edamos). El ch\u00f3fer de la empresa contratada nos llama y nos dice por que si no le pagamos m\u00e1s (en efectivo) se marcha. Le dijimos que no y NOS DEJ\u00d3 TIRADOS. A la vuelta reclamamos la devoluci\u00f3n del dinero a Viajes ECI y nos dicen que la empresa contratada d\u00e1 por efectuado el servicio y se lava las manos como Pilatos y que Viajes ECI no puede hacer nada m\u00e1s. Es incomprensible c\u00f3mo una empresa puede ser tan MISERIA.\nEl viaje anterior cuesta muchos miles de euros para que, primero, se bajen los pantalones ante el proveedor de ese servicio en EEUU y segundo, no me devuelvan 185 euros que costaba el servicio no prestado. RIDICULA MISERIA DE VIAJES ECI. Evidentemente, no me ven por all\u00ed de nuevo."

    "content": "Soldi scalati dalla carta e ordine non consegnato\nHo scoperto il sito online di Primor l\u2019anno scorso e, in svariate occasioni, ho effettuato degli ordini senza riscontrare alcun problema. Tuttavia, per il Black Friday (25/11/23), ho acquistato dei prodotti che non sono mai giunti a destinazione (nonostante i soldi mi siano stati scalati dalla carta di credito ben due giorni dopo). Ho atteso tre settimane prima di contattare l\u2019assistenza, stupidamente convinta che il ritardo fosse dovuto ai tanti ordini ricevuti. Poi, durante la quarta settimana, ho provato a scrivere numerose mail tramite i ticket -alle quali, ovviamente, ho a stento ricevuto una risposta-. Sono stata rimborsata dopo giorni e giorni in cui provavo a contattarli ovunque. Ma, viste le esperienze passate positive, ho deciso di dar loro un\u2019altra possibilit\u00e0 quindi, la scorsa settimana (20/02/24), ho acquistato altri prodotti online. Ho atteso solo cinque giorni e poi li ho contattati: ovviamente, a loro il mio ordine non \u00e8 mai arrivato, seppur il pagamento sia andato a buon fine. Ho ricevuto una risposta dopo l\u2019invio degli screen richiesti? Assolutamente no. Ho letto in questo sito che in molti hanno riscontrato il mio stesso problema, di conseguenza la domanda mi sorge spontanea: come mai gli ordini sono risultati \u201cnulli\u201d quando ho acquistato dei prodotti costosi a prezzi convenienti e non in tutte le altre occasioni in cui non erano presenti sconti? E, sopratutto, vi pare normale che dobbiamo rimetterci noi clienti quando il problema \u00e8 palese che provenga esclusivamente dal vostro sito? Chiedo, gentilmente, che tutto ci\u00f2 ordinato mi venga consegnato prima di procedere per vie legali."

But I have to say, I think I like this one more than my old one. I love all the nice organizational pockets this has, and there's even a slot in the laptop compartment that fits my charger and brick! I have an Alienware m17, and it fits perfectly in the padded laptop pocket. The backpack is made of what feels like a very durable canvas like material. The zippers are smooth, which is good and bad, especially on the laptop part, which could flop open if you're not careful. The straps are comfy and the bonus \"secret\" pocket on the bottom of the bag is a nice bonus. In fact, there's a few hidden pockets on this thing! This backpack would be fantastic for travelling, especially since it has loops you can put luggage locks on. I use it as an everyday bag for work, and it certainly serves me well. I highly recommend this backpack!"

They connect quickly to my iPhone. They fit very securely and comfortably in my ears. I can wear them for long time. The sound quality and the wireless charging case are amazing at this price point. Noise cancelling is also very good. Some cons, however are:\n1. There doesn't seem to be a transparency mode. If they are in your ear, they will block much of the outside noise.\n2. They don't recognize when they are out of your ears, so music keeps playing.\n3. Because they are small and the surface is touch-sensitive, it is very easy to send false commands to stop/start music if you accidentally touch them (e.g. to adjust fit)\n4. I did encounter the common bug where the left earbud stops working. While this is annoying, the solution was fairly straightforward: \"Forget Device\" on iPhone. Turn off Bluetooth on iPhone. Place the buds in case. Take them out again so they are flashing blue/red. Re-enable Bluetooth on iPhone. Click on the earbuds name once they show up to reconnect. If this doesn't work, contact customer support. I hear they are very helpful."

The tea arrived in a durable tin with little advertising, a plus in our kitchen where we strive to maintain a calm, uncluttered atmosphere.  One recommendation,  be sure that you use filtered water when brewing and steep for 4 and one half minutes, no shorter, no longer."

I like these compared to what I was using before as I don\u2019t need to have the volume all the way turned up as I did on my last ones. They\u2019ve worked well in rainy conditions and while working out. They also come with different ear pad sizes to fit in your ears perfectly"

She was flexible knowledgeable and always responded to my questions and concerns in a timely and respectful fashion. I cannot say enough about her level of professionalism and thoroughness.  \n\nCompletely outstanding. \n\nOur guide for the 9 days was Dixon.  He was so knowledgeable about the animals birds floral etc. we learned so much from him.  He was so skilled in finding the animals for us and did everything he could to ensure all our dreams and expectations of a safari were met.  He consistently checked in with us to ensure our needs were met.  One of the most endearing qualities  was his obvious respect and love for the animals.  We were a group of 5 women who love animals so much and Dixon totally met our needs here. He was so patient when we wanted to watch the simplist of animals and was open to all our crazy questions. He ensured we got as much fame driving as we wanted.   He met our needs in terms of tenderness and live of the animals and one could tell this wasn\u2019t just a job for him. He was passionate about what he was seeing out in the game reserves.  We always felt completely safe with him and trusted him with our lives. He never once let us down.  Our experience was beyond what we were expecting.  Right from the start of exploring a safari to the completion of our trip I cannot say enough amazing things about this company and Dixon their guide. Highly recommend."

Images added also have a mind of their own and the options for images sometimes don\u2019t work. You type something and go get a cup of tea, the app restarts on its own and you loose what you typed. Takes a long time to colour text etc and you justify something to the centre and the top paragraph also does so.

I contacted the support on chat. I was told that I had a wrong payment card. I requested to get a refund for the product I had paid for and not received. They claimed that they couldn't make this refund. I suggested that they instead could reactivate my account until the end of the paid term. They could not help me with that. The boss of the support team couldn't help me neither. Conclusion:Netflix don't care about breaking the law by stealing your money. Is this a company you want to support?

(please read the review it will cover whatever is needed)\nOriginally got this backpack for my eldest son's senior year and used it on a daily now second semester of freshman in college still in amazing shape. there are multiple sections to the bag letting you divide your stuff easier. I put 4 stars for security because trying to unzip and take it would not be a hard task. A definite 5 starts for commuting because it has a very comfortable back and keeps stuff in place well. Lastly, the only reason I put 4 stars on traveling is because it's hard to store stuff since there are so many different slots most stuff doesn't fit but would be a great carry-on. In conclusion, this backpack is great for school and carry-on coming in at a price that matches the quality perfectly."

Next, the one thing travellers want is to know if a hostel is friendly: especially if it\u2019s a place they can easily connect with people and meet other travellers.  Again, the app fails to include this in the metrics it lays out (atmosphere is the closest metric, but you need to dive into the comments to find out properly).

On Friday 8th March I made a Reservation for two nights with Franz Josef Montrose through Hostelworld, with the Flexible Deposit Protection option. I arrived after the checkin time of 8pm, so I cancelled my booking for both nights. I was charged by FranzJosef Montrose for both nights, despite their cancellation policy stating that the cost of only one night is to be paid upon cancellation. They have sent me an email stating that they have refunded me the cost of one night, however this transaction has not yet taken place according to my account balance via my internet banking. Also I have not received back my deposit of US$20.87, on which I chose the \u201cFlexible Deposit Protection\u201d option. It seems that making bookings  through Hostelworld is not free of errors and potentially exploitive if the errors escape the customers attention. I am unhappy with both Franz Josef Montrose and Hostelworld. \nAnd another difficulty I experienced  was when I attempted phoning the number listed on your website. It is not compatible with Telstra Australia, the biggest service provider in Australia. \nThe Hostelworld/ Franz Josef Montrose experience has been anything but easy and trouble free."

This is probably all a big scam Edit: and yet here we go with another problem with this company. I cancelled all of my bookings on hostelworld, but somehow one of them did not go through. Funnily enough, the cancellation that did not go through was also the most expensive booking out of all of them. Well, because there is no record of me cancelling it, even though I\u2019m 100% sure I did, I will be charged the full amount of my stay which is over 300 dollars. This seems to be some technical issue with this company and now I\u2019m being punished for it. I paid for free cancellation as well, but don\u2019t trust that because if you don\u2019t cancel before 24hrs then they will charge you the entire booking. I will be filing a chargeback with my credit card because no other company or any other booking does this"

Intentamos contactar con  nuestra agencia DE VIAJES EL CORTE INGLES despu\u00e9s de muchos intentos, (est\u00e1bamos navegando y las comunicaciones no son muy f\u00e1ciles), nos prometen que contactaran con la naviera y dar\u00e1n una soluci\u00f3n....\n\nA nosotros se nos dicen por parte del CORTE INGLES que deben solucionarlo la naviera y a la naviera les dice que nosotros est\u00e1bamos informados de como era el camarote,  lo cual era totalmente falso. \n\nCOSTA CRUCEROS nos puso una cama supletoria a los pies de las otras dos quedando reducido de  tal manera que no pod\u00edamos estar de pie al mismo tiempo. En un primer momento la cama tenia las baldas rotas y el colch\u00f3n estaba sucio, algo que rectificaron posteriormente.\n\nEntre todas estas incidencias y reclamaciones se nos fue una semana...sin darnos soluci\u00f3n.  Proponemos a COSTA CRUCEROS que mientras esperamos contestaci\u00f3n del CORTE INGLES nos cambien de camarote, como ellos insisten en que paguemos la diferencia aceptamos pagar desde la fecha en la que nos cambien cual no es nuestra sorpresa cuando nos dicen que si que tienen camarotes disponibles, pero que es un paquete y debemos pagar desde el inicio del crucero 15 d\u00edas cuando solo disfrutar\u00edamos 7 d\u00edas del nuevo camarote. Un robo.....\n\nNo quer\u00edamos un camarote mejor solo uno en el que no tuvi\u00e9ramos que subirnos a dormir en una litera y pudi\u00e9ramos alojarnos de una manera decente.\n\nTambi\u00e9n queremos hacer referencia de la falta de profesionalidad, respeto y educaci\u00f3n de a una de las trabajadoras del departamento de atenci\u00f3n al cliente, que aun teniendo su nombre no queremos mencionarlo (demostramos tener mas consideraci\u00f3n de la que tuvo ella)......al re\u00edrse y comentar abiertamente, de  nuestra situaci\u00f3n  con una compa\u00f1era y otros clientes (que por cierto no respetaron el turno)."

Cute kitchen and lots of plugs in bed and around hostel. \nNot so good:  needs more hooks in general. There are none in the rooms at all. Ended up hanging towel near window to dry. There are no seats at all in the shower area or bathroom. So, with no hooks or seats, you are holding onto everything to keep from getting wet or putting in floor.  The locker is on the floor under the bed. At first you think, that is smart. No, every time you want something, have to get on the floor, pull it all the way out and then push back. No napkins or things to put over food in microwave to prevent splatters.  Directions for micro are so small, need a magnifying glass to read. I recommend the owner actually checking in and using the hostel like travelers do and most of this can be easily remedied. \nBad:  laundry service. Yes, it is wash and dry. But that is it!  I didn't expect underwear of socks to be folded but pants and shirts?  Instead, they were all thrown into a bag to get super wrinkled. No one told me this. Ever other place includes folding. If not, TELL ME.  I would have gladly been right there to fold or gone elsewhere. When I asked front desk to reset with a damp cloth to steam out clothes, I was told to come back in 2 hours. I go back in an hour just to check and then I'm told that they were not going to do it without another charge.  Well, you know what room I am in, why not come tell me?  You have my phone number and email to tell me.  None of that happened.  I know this is minor, but lack of communication is everything. \nReally bad:  letting clearly ill people stay in a room with other people. My room has a woman who is very sick, coughing, and cannot get out of bed. Yet, she is with 9 others, and not even keeping her curtain closed."

I ordered Scottish breakfast. Someone mislabeled it, TWICE! (Both amazon labels on the tin say Scottish breakfast).\nI ended up with the tea room blend which is a completely different tea.\nUnfortunately these items are non-returnable and there seems to be no other way to request a missing item.

We were fortunate to be upgraded to a spacious room with large bathroom, balcony overlooking the sea and well kept gardens, also a very comfy bed and good storage. The whole resort was immaculately clean especially the pools and walkways. The entertainment was varied with local music and dancing each night. I would definitely go back and recommend it to family and friends."

I'm not a \"supertaster,\" but just an ordinary person. I thought it was really good and so much better than the tea in the bags. It seems like it is strong with caffeine, which I found surprising.

Bueno, pues no llega y hago la reclamaci\u00f3n del dinero y hasta hoy, d\u00eda 9 de febrero, no me lo han devuelto, tras escribir 20 mensajes y reclamar el dinero por el banco, no me han dicho nada. Que tienen problemas con el correo Yahoo y que vuelva a enviar reclamaci\u00f3n por otro correo.

Many settings are inaccessible using non-standard controls so I am unable to set up location and other such profile information. So much more is non standard that after hours and hours trying to get a minimum of access I have had to give up on this app totally. It\u2019s great to see private social networks like this but truly sad that not one I have tried is decently accessible for people with blindness/low vision when Apple provide tons of information for willing progressive and inclusive developers."

The menu had a great variety of options and my Aperol Spritz was fantastic, not only because it was huge :-). The food was delicious, we shared the croquettes and I had the supreme of chicken and my husband the pork - both exceptionally tasty and generous portions, with different vegetable accompaniements, not the same vegetables on each plate that we have encountered in both France and Italy.  The waiters were friendly, attentive and professional and had great senses of humour and fantastic English without being condescending.  All in all a great experience exceeding our expectations.

However unfortunately the navigation between different sections of the app is not intuitive, and there is little breathing room for the community to establish itself and the way it works before you\u2019re thrown right into an overwhelming feed of \u2018stuff\u2019. This makes the experience really hard to use and engage with the audience.\n\nI would also suggest showing previews of the first couple of comments under a post and not having them hidden behind a tiny chat icon."

I felt so at ease, calm, and manifesting became easier because I was constantly in a state of bliss and gratitude.\nWhen the bottle finished (I originally thought this was a Costco only find and he was the one with the membership) that I found a bought a different brand of ashwaganda here on Amazon.\nI immediately noticed my happiness fade and normal life stressors were actually making me severely depressed (versus being on Youtheory were these stressors were not a bother and I was able to overcome them gracefully).\nWhen the other brand of ashwaganda began to run low, I searched on Amazon for a \"high customer reviewed\" brand but none really called my name. I googled \"costco brand ashwaganda\" wondering if indeed, this was a Costco only find (and I was ready and willing to grab a membership just for this!).. to my deligh, I found this Amazon seller! I was overjoyed and thrilled and immediately purchased my bottle.\nI am pleased to announce I am now 4 days into taking Youtheory ashwaganda again and I feel like the old me. I am a forever customer now :) !!!"

Also, the container is huge for absolutely no reason. It comes hardly half filled, seems to be a waste of material.

Also the iPad app will not orient upside down, with power button at bottom. Sometimes I hold it this way in my lap if I have a power cable attached. Most apps orient ok, but not this one.

Hicimos un viaje mediante la Agencia del Corte Ingles, con el operador CLUB DE VACACIONES. El viaje era a Israel-Lugares Santos. El viaje fue muy intenso en cuanto a contenido, de tal forma que no nos dejaron ni una hora libre para poder recorrer a nuestro aire la ciudad de Jerusal\u00e9n. Nos llevaron a algunos hoteles y restaurante, que estaban abarrotados de gente, con lo cual, a pesar de su categor\u00eda, era muy inc\u00f3modo. No nos dejaron comprar en mercadillos ni tiendas, ya que solo nos llevaron a dos tiendas que finalmente, no dispon\u00edan de productos para turistas normales, porque eran tiendas de art\u00edculos de lujo. Tuvimos un problema con una excursi\u00f3n opcional, ya que en pleno YOM KIPURR, la visita a Jerusal\u00e9n nocturno, no se pudo realizar por el gent\u00edo que hab\u00eda y los atascos de tr\u00e1fico, total que al final nos pasamos 5 horas metidos en un autob\u00fas sin poder salir y sin ver nada de la ciudad.. Pues bien, hicimos una reclamaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s del Corte Ingl\u00e9s del dinero que hab\u00edamos pagado, nos dijeron que la tramitar\u00edan al operador, pero a\u00fan no tenemos respuesta alguna. Ten\u00edamos un seguro que hicimos tambi\u00e9n con el Corte Ingl\u00e9s, y no nos cubri\u00f3 ninguna contingencia, porque a la vuelta, IBERIA extravi\u00f3 nuestro equipaje, y el seguro no se hizo cargo de ninguna indemnizaci\u00f3n. La respuesta del CORTE INGL\u00c9S  a nuestras reclamaciones ha sido NULA"

I guess this is what helps keep the price down, but also keeps them simple (less to go wrong) and helps with battery life.  However, it means that choosing the correct sized of eartips, from those supplied, is very important since you will be relying just on the passive sound isolation to limit external noise."

Mega lang in de wacht gestaan met uiteindelijk de medeling dat mijn betaling geweigerd zou zijn en ik contact moest opnemen met mijn financi\u00eble instelling. Het is gewoon afgeschreven via mjjn Rabobank naar hetzelfde rekeningnummer als altijd. Onzin natuurlijk. Ik kreeg zogenaamd een financieel overzicht waaruit dit zou blijken. Dit bleek gewoon het overzicht vanuit mijn account waar mijn voorgaande betalingen  op stonden en de betaling van deze maand nog niet tussen stond. Een wezenloos meisje aan de telefoon bleef maar herhalen: u moet contact opnemen met uw financi\u00eble instelling. Ik vroeg of ik een betaalbewijs kon mailen, weer 10 min in de wacht waarna ze terugkwam met precied hetzelfde verhaal. Mails komen niet aan bij Netflix, de chat is buitenwerking en bij het callcenter krijg je alleen info die je zelf ook kunt inzien. Ik ga geen \u20ac40 betalen voor 1 maand Netflix en heb dan ook maar opgezegd. Die \u20ac20 ben ik nu wel kwijt. Het is geen wereldbedrag, maar ik vind dit ronduit schandalig. Ik zie meer reviews voorbij komen van mensen die hetzelfde probleem hebben. Echt belachelijk dat zo'n organisatie niet te bereiken is en je geld verdwijnt in het niets."

The water was calm, so no sea sickness; thankfully as I am a bad sailor. The island of Koh Phangan is beautiful with a smattering of houses and resorts. Lunch was served, a selection of 5 delicious Thai dishes plus all the fruit you could eat. We stopped to snorkel at Koh Ma , a beautiful cove framed by golden sands. My husband said the fish and coral were beautiful. We set sail again heading to Koh Phangan where we had a choice of massages, walks along the beach or drinks at the bar. All tips at the bar go towards the street dogs. We set sail for  home, enjoying g a spectacular sunset as we returned. Our entry to port was celebrated with fireworks from the onboard cannon."

Jetzt ist er noch teurer als am Anfang M\u00e4rz.\nVorgeschichte: Wir bekommen seit dem Brexit unseren Assam-Tee von der selben Firma nur mit Schwierigkeiten. Den Assam hatten wir Jahre lang zum Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck. Der ersatzweise bestellte Dallmayr-Assam kam sogar nicht mehr. So nahm ich diesen Tee ins Spar-Abo. Aber dieser Breakfast-Tee ist zu sehr pulverig und ein Teil kommt durch das feine Teesieb durch. Es macht Sud. Nach dem Abgie\u00dfen von 4 Tassen Tee (mit 4 Teel\u00f6ffel Tee) in die Teekanne ist das Sieb jedes Mal derartig verstopft, dass die Sp\u00fclmaschine nicht schafft, es sauber zu bekommen. Seit gestern Morgen lege ich das Sieb nach dem Abseihen gleich ins Wasser, und nach dem Fr\u00fchst\u00fcck putze ich es m\u00fchsam mit einer B\u00fcrste."

Incredibly annoying bug / new behaviour\n\nI recently made a custom sticker on WhatsApp, I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019s what prompted this new behaviour"

I just based it on the measurement when I put a tape measure to my foot.\nSince I'm wearing this as an \"everyday shoe\" I've put in some insoles which have made them a bit tighter but the leather will eventually adjust. Happy with my purchase!"
